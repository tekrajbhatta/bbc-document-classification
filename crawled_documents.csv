"Reeves rejects claims of  50bn  black hole  in finances. The chancellor hit back at the idea that the government faces so large a gap between spending and tax income. Rachel Reeves has rejected forecasts of a  50bn  black hole  in the public finances, despite higher borrowing costs and expected tax rises piling pressure on the chancellor ahead of the autumn Budget.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Reeves hit back at reports speculating over her plans, arguing that  a lot of them are talking rubbish .It comes after the cost of long-term government borrowing rose to a 27-year high on Tuesday, fuelling concerns the chancellor will have to hike taxes or cut spending.Reeves said she would aim to  get the balance right  at the Budget, which will be on 26 November, but the Conservatives said the government  don t know what they re doing . Reeves told the BBC   Working people and businesses can rest assured, I know how important it is to return growth in investments to our economy and I will do that in the Budget this year. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride accused the government of not having a plan and of  stalling  the Budget  in the vain hope things might get better .Faisal Islam  Reeves will need her hard hat for the next three months Last month, an independent think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research  Niesr , estimated that the chancellor would need to plug a  50bn gap in the public finances.But the chancellor played down the figure and told the BBC Niesr had  more than most got their numbers wrong in the last few years .Forecasts for how much money Reeves needs to find to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules vary widely, with some estimates putting the figure at around  25bn.Reeves has two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These are day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Ahead of the election, Labour pledged not to increase taxes on  working people , which included VAT, National Insurance  NI  and income tax.However, at the Budget last year, she increased the amount of NI employers have to pay, which led to a backlash from many businesses and sectors, such as hospitality.U-turns on proposed welfare cuts and winter fuel payments have also put pressure on the chancellor to find alternative revenue streams.It has led to speculation the chancellor is considering tax rises on property, banks and people, but Reeves hit back at such reports. People who seem to know what is in the Budget before we have made those decisions are just wrong,  she told the BBC. A lot of them are talking rubbish, and frankly, a lot of what they re saying is irresponsible. It s up to me to decide what is in the Budget, and I will do that in a careful way, getting the balance right between making sure that we ve got enough money to find our public services, particularly our National Health Service , whilst also ensuring that we can bring growth and investment to Britain,  she added.Reflecting on this week s changes of personnel in Downing Street, and the beefing up of the prime minister s economic team, she said she was working  in lockstep  with Number 10.The chancellor also denied that recent sharp increases in government borrowing costs hurt her credibility, saying they have  moved in line with other countries . There are global pressures on borrowing costs. You can see that around the world, from the United States to Europe and beyond. We re not immune to those,  she said. In recent days long-term borrowing costs across the world have increased, amid concerns about political uncertainty, levels of debt, and a structural shift in pension funds away from such bonds.Some commentators have argued that the UK s financial position is so weak that it will need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, but Reeves said  serious economists  don t accept that idea.She argued there were  lots of positive signs  in the economy, but accepted that more needed to be done so that  working people wherever they live, actually feel the benefits of that growth .Asked about whether she would return to the bill for welfare to make the Budget numbers add up, she said   The welfare state should always be there for people who really need it, but we also need to do more to ensure that everyone who can work does work. After the recent U-turn on welfare cuts, the terms of reference for Work and Pensions Minister Stephen Timms  review of disability benefits is expected shortly. Some Labour MPs are also campaigning for extra spending to alleviate child poverty by reversing the two-child benefit cap.The chancellor was speaking to the BBC ahead of the announcement of the Budget date.",business,Reeves rejects claims of £50bn 'black hole' in finances,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27nm2mn5po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:00:44 GMT",827
"Faisal Islam  Reeves has a bumpy road up to the Budget. The chancellor hits back at speculation over tax rises, but will need to find the money from somewhere. It is going to be a long 12 weeks, critical to the chancellor, the government and the nation s economy.Rachel Reeves chose to talk to me at a Birmingham housebuilding development to launch the Budget process as she tried her hand at some bricklaying. However, the obligatory hard hat might come in rather handy away from the site as the chancellor wanted to get across that the point of her Budget would not just be to  raise enough money  for public services - which is code for tax rises. She wants to be known as a reforming chancellor who made much-needed structural reforms to how the tax system operates, in a bid to boost economic productivity and growth to improve living standards.First and foremost, that requires a reassertion that she is in charge of this process. I will make the decisions,  she said,  in lockstep  with Number 10.Reeves dismisses  50bn  black hole  in UK finances That statement is in a week of economist transfers where the Treasury has become something of a feeder club to Number 10.Off the junior ministers  bench has been Darren Jones, Reeves  former deputy, who has taken up a newly-created role as Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister. Football analogies aside, the immediate challenge facing Reeves is the size of the gap in the public finances.The chancellor chose to dismiss the suggestion of a   50bn black hole , and talk of a need for a visit to the International Monetary Fund to request a bailout.She also savaged some of the Budget speculation over tax rises on property, banks and pensions as not just  wrong  but  irresponsible .The Treasury says it has not been flying kites over the summer. I also put to her the very interesting words of the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR  in July, on levelling with the public that  promises made are constantly not kept  on tax and spending.There was the mildest air of annoyance with the forecaster whose analyses are so critical to the Budget process. The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce four forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy,  she replied.While the chancellor has been a massive supporter of the OBR, granting it more independence, this nerdy point could reflect some looming tension over its assessment of her economic policies.Expect some considerable haggling with the OBR from the freshly recruited array of high-powered Downing Street economists.Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules around borrowing, she says.But there will be pressure from her backbenchers to fudge them.What spending reductions could be on the cards? Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8 , down.Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics. It s going to be a rough ride to 26 November.",business,Faisal Islam: Reeves has a bumpy road up to the Budget,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:00:57 GMT",570
"Newsmax sues Fox News in battle of right-wing TV networks. Newsmax accuses its more established rival of engaging in a campaign to stunt its business that violates competition law. Right-wing US media network Newsmax is suing Fox News over what it claims are anticompetitive tactics to supress competition, teeing up a legal battle in the American conservative news space.The lawsuit, filed in a Florida federal court, accuses Fox News of using its market power to coerce TV providers to restrict competing right-leaning channels. Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can t attract viewers,  a Fox News spokesperson said.The company, owned by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is consistently ranked the most popular conservative news outlet in the US with a market value of nearly  26bn   19bn . Fox News  has long engaged in an exclusionary scheme to increase and maintain its dominance in the market for US right-leaning pay TV news,  lawyers for Newsmax wrote in its antitrust complaint. It s alleged Fox News uses exclusive content deals to block other right-wing channels, and imposes financial penalties on providers that do carry other conservative networks, among other exclusionary tactics. The suit also accuses Fox News of using intimidation including pressuring its guests to not appear on rival networks, and hiring private investigators to target Newsmax executives Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over,  Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said.It s asking a judge to declare Fox News  conduct unlawful, and block it from entering into what it says are exclusionary contracts, in addition to monetary damages. Newsmax, founded in 1998 with a market value of  1.8bn, has gained traction in recent years, buoyed by support from President Donald Trump.The company had its own legal woes in the wake of Joe Biden s 2020 election victory over Trump.Newsmax agreed to pay  67m   50m  to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a voting machine company over false claims it rigged the election.Dominion, which filed the case in 2021, had accused Newsmax of broadcasting  verifiably false lies .Fox News was also embroiled in litigation with Dominion, agreeing to settle a  787.5m   634m  lawsuit following the election.",business,Newsmax sues Fox News in battle of right-wing TV networks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jzlgw1d7eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:37:21 GMT",374
"M S hackers claim to be behind Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack. The hack has caused severe disruption at manufacturing plants globally, with some staff told not to come into work. A group of young English-speaking hackers are claiming to be behind the cyber attack which has halted the global production lines of Jaguar Land Rover  JLR .The group is bragging about the hack on the messaging app Telegram, sharing screenshots apparently taken from inside the car maker s IT networks.The gang is also responsible for a wave of cyber attacks on UK retailers including M S in the spring - and are calling themselves  Scattered Lapsus  Hunters . Where is my new car, Land Rover,  the hackers - who are thought to be teens - posted to taunt the company. The BBC has approached JLR for comment. In private text conversations with one of the criminals, who claims to be the spokesperson for the group, they said they are trying to extort the car company for money.But the hacker would not say if they have successfully stolen private data from JLR or installed malicious software onto the company s network.The hacker wouldn t provide any more evidence they are responsible for the hack - and they are known to lie to get attention.But two images posted by the group show apparent internal instructions for troubleshooting a car charging issue and internal computer logs.One security expert has speculated the screenshots suggest the criminals have access to information they should not have. Based on the information provided by the attackers and open source intelligence, the attack has access to JLR s internal systems and network,  security researcher Kevin Beaumont said.A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner s Office said   Jaguar Land Rover has reported an incident and we are assessing the information provided.  Car production at sites including the Halewood plant in Merseyside and another in Solihull have been heavily disrupted since the attack was discovered on Sunday.Staff have been sent home and JLR has said it s working to get manufacturing back online.The company has not disclosed the nature of the attack. We took immediate action to mitigate its impact by proactively shutting down our systems, it said in a statement.  We are now working at pace to restart our global applications in a controlled manner. At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted. The hackers chose the name Scattered Lapsus  Hunters to reflect the merging of various youth-orientated cyber criminals who are all associated with a network called The Com.Earlier this year the National Crime Agency warned of the growing threat from cyber criminals in The Com.The newly named group is a mixture of hackers who have been part of the groups Shiny Hunters, Lapsus  and Scattered Spider - all notorious young hacking groups of the last few years that emerged from The Com.The Telegram channel used by the criminals now has nearly 52,000 subscribers. The group has been bragging about hacks and sharing incomprehensible in-jokes for days. It s the forth such Telegram channel as previous ones have been closed down.Scattered Spider is name of a loosely linked group of hackers responsible for high profile attacks on M S, Co-op and Harrods in April and May.In July the National Crime Agency arrested 4 people in connection to the hacks. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, and three males - aged between 17 and 19 - were detained in London and the West Midlands. All have since been released on bail.

"Tesco trials avocado ripeness scanners. Fans of the fruit are divided over whether it s a shopping hack or if a squeeze test should suffice. Tesco is trialling avocado ripeness scanners and fans of the fruit are divided over whether it is a shopping hack or if a squeeze test should suffice.Avocado toast has become synonymous with the millennial generation but it relies on the main ingredient being soft enough for smashing.Shoppers at five Tesco stores in England can scan their avocados to find out how ripe they are. Tom Allingham, money expert at Save the Student, says it s  only fair  people know what they re paying for.But James Herring, CEO at brand consultancy Taylor Herring, thinks it s a tech gimmick and giving an avocado  a quick squeeze  works just as well.  Britain s supermarkets are locked in a never-ending battle for attention and spend, so every day brings a new gimmick,  he says. Tesco s avocado scanner has done its job  it s sparked chatter about food waste and burnished the brand s innovation credentials. Sure, you could put 100  of the marketing budget into store upgrades or slightly faster checkouts, but those fixes don t grab the headlines or make for good TikTok content.  Tesco s avocado buyer Lisa Lawrence says social media had played a part in predicting the popularity of the tech s soft launch. Smashed avocado on sourdough continues to be one of the trendiest snacks at the moment, garnering millions of views on social media sites for recipe ideas, so we think, for that reason, the scanner will be really popular with shoppers,  she said.Tesco says this year it has sold almost 15 million more avocados than it did in the previous 52 weeks. The scanner will enable shoppers to choose the avocado that is right for them and which therefore can help them plan their usage and desired shelf life,  says Ms Lawrence.The avocado scanners are in the fruit aisles in Cheshunt Extra and Colchester Superstore in Essex, Stratford upon Avon Superstore in Warwickshire, Wokingham Superstore in Berkshire and Salisbury Extra in Wiltshire. This is the latest tech update from the supermarket since its trial of giant trolley scales at a store in Gateshead led to some shoppers comparing it to airport security.Georgia Rose, a senior consultant at Kantar, thinks the avocado scanners will take off. Assurance around quality and value play an important role in influencing what we buy, so innovations like these need trialling to assess both how effective they are at reducing waste and how they impact customer satisfaction, before any broader rollout,  she said.Mr Allingham from Save the Student said he didn t buy into  the myth that young people buy too many avocados  and said he hoped the cost of the machines would not push prices up for customers. Given the rising cost of food and the enduring cost of living crisis for students... if that s the trade-off, then cheaper food is clearly the preference,  he says.",business,Tesco trials avocado ripeness scanners,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzxxlxky4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:04:31 GMT",502
"Will drones deliver your next hot food order?. A Swedish firm hopes that drones will open up a new market for hot food delivery. Meal delivery is a luxury city dwellers take for granted - but more options are opening up for non-urban residents.Boasting nearly 700,000 islands collectively, Sweden, Norway and Finland are home to the most islands in the world, their coastlines dotted by archipelagos that have shaped their history and culture.While a number of the islands are accessible by ferry and bridge to residents of the region s cities, there s one thing locals are often missing  hot food delivery to their door, a service their city cousins probably take for granted.But Norwegian start-up Aviant wants to change that, by establishing the region s first food delivery service by drone - starting on the Swedish island of Värmdö. Värmdö is just eight miles  13km  from Stockholm as the crow flies, and accessible by car, bus and ferry. But its population of around 46,000 - rising to up to 100,000 in the summer - has few hot food delivery options.During a video call, Aviant co-founder and CEO, Lars Erik Fagernæs, shows me a map of the islands closest to Stockholm. All of the white and blue squares are where  delivery services  Foodora and Wolt have a service, and all of the black squares are where they don t,  says Mr Fagernæs, who is based in the Norwegian city of Trondheim. As you can see on the map, there are 87,000 people who don t have access to a home delivery service. These people live in what you would call suburbs, and would want to order takeaway food, but they just don t have an option. Since February, though, residents of Gustavsberg, the main town on Värmdö, and surrounding areas, have been able to order freshly made burgers from Scandinavian chain Bastard Burgers directly to their door via drone, using Aviant s technology.The cost of delivery is comparable to that of a car or bike service, as drones take out the cost of the driver.At the moment Aviant is in a  beta phase  - only delivering 10 items a week, while they check everything works.But the plan is to scale up as the year goes on. Aviant is also set to launch a similar service on the Norwegian peninsula of Nesodden - just four miles in distance from Oslo, but a 29-mile road journey. Mr Fagernæs demonstrates once again on a map. All the white is where you don t currently have a food delivery service. So it s about 100,000 people that s going to now have access to home delivery that didn t have it before,  he says.It hasn t been a straightforward process to perfect, Mr Fagernæs admits, as several trials were needed to ensure the food stayed hot and fresh during the maximum flight time of up to 10 minutes, over a radius of up to six miles. We have been testing this for three years, and in the beginning, there were a lot of soggy fries,  he recalls.  But we have improved the isolated container the burger goes in, and now we know it arrives warm, even in the winter months. People go crazy for it. They call their neighbors and their grandma. They think it s like a UFO delivering their food.  Mr Fagernæs hopes the two pilot services will provide the  recipe , as he describes it, to embark on a full-scale rollout across Scandinavia, where many communities like those on Värmdö and Nessoden are beholden to their geography. He points back to the map. We don t have huge cities, but these areas are viable for drone delivery, where they are on the border of urban with rural, which is very hard to serve by car, and that is a lot of the population in Scandinavia,  says Mr Fagernæs.Aviant has identified around 40 bases across Scandinavia to expand to over the next two years, and sees similar geography in Canada, which has over 52,000 islands, and the north eastern region of the US, characterised by lakes, mountains and islands.And what about the weather. Mr Fagernæs admits high winds will ground the drones occasionally, but expects the service to have 90  uptime. As for flying drones to deliver food into really remote areas, Aviant is one of a number of drone firms to have tested the waters, but found the numbers did not add up. Starting in 2022, Aviant delivered Thai, Italian and sushi to residents outside of Trondheim. But that service was ended in August 2023.Meanwhile, in 2022, UK firm Skyports delivered school meals to children in the Orkney islands, funded by Argyll and Bute Council, and temporarily ran a  fish and chip Fridays  delivery service to the wider community.Similarly, German firm Wingcopter delivered everyday goods to rural residents in 2023 as part of a government partnership. In China s eastern Zhejiang province, a local council is funding drone delivery of hot meals to elderly villagers isolated in the mountains.But continuing these services without a government or corporate sponsor is not commercially viable.Given the distances, the cost of delivery would be prohibitive for the person ordering, and too much for the outlet providing the food to waive. And, being rural areas, there aren t enough locals to generate sufficient orders to begin with.",business,Will drones deliver your next hot food order?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlze41zygdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 23:05:14 GMT",891
"Bank of England  very concerned  at Trump threats to US Fed. Andrew Bailey said the attacks, led by the US president, are  a very serious situation . The Bank of England governor has warned that threats to the US Federal Reserve s independence are  very serious  and a  very dangerous road to go down  as President Donald Trump continues to target America s central bank.Andrew Bailey told the Treasury Select Committee   This is a very serious situation, I am very concerned.  Trump has repeatedly attacked Fed chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates and attempted to fire one of its governors, Lisa Cook who is now suing the US president.Mr Bailey is latest central banker to raise the alarm after European Central Bank  ECB  president Christine Lagarde said a loss of independence was a  very serious danger  to the global economy. Ms Lagarde warned that if the Fed was forced to respond to presidential orders it would have a  very worrying  effect on economic stability around the world.Mr Bailey echoed her concerns, telling MPs   The Federal Reserve is the central bank for the world s largest economy. It is a leading central bank. It has built up a very strong reputation for independence and its decision-making so this is very concerning. Trump has made it clear that since returning to the White House in January that he would like to see large cuts in official interest rates which have remained at between 4.25  to 4.5  since last December. In contrast, the ECB and the Bank of England have cut borrowing costs a number of times since last year.Trump has repeatedly attacked Mr Powell for not doing the same - calling him  too late  and claiming he is  lousy  at his job. Mr Bailey said it was the job of central banks to ensure that economies were stable, which allowed governments to take policy decisions  knowing the foundations are sound .He said what was happening now in the US was politicians deciding they  should be able to trade off the foundations for those other decisions . I just think that is a very dangerous road to go down,  he said. On domestic interest rates, Mr Bailey told the committee said there was now less certainty about how quickly the Bank would continue to make cuts. The next decision is due on 18 September. There is now considerably more doubt about exactly when and how quickly we can make those further steps,  he said but added the path remained  downwards gradually over time .Last month, the Bank of England cut UK interest rates from 4.25  to 4 , but in an unprecedented move the Bank s policymakers needed two votes to reach a decision.That suggested future decisions on interest rate cuts would be finely balanced.Mr Bailey told the BBC at the time the path for interest rates continued to be  downwards  but the path was   a bit more uncertain frankly  as inflation - the rate at which the cost of goods and services increases - was continuing to rise.The Bank began cutting interest rates from its recent high of 5.25  in August last year.Mr Bailey told MPs on Wednesday the UK was not seeing inflationary pressure from higher tariffs introduced by Trump  as of yet , noting that their impact could be  ambiguous . If the world economy started to fragment and we got supply chain pressures as we did after Covid, of course, that would be inflationary,  he said.He added that if the UK receives more Chinese exports as a result of high tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, that could in fact push prices down. We have to keep watching this closely,  he said. Meanwhile, Mr Bailey questioned recent coverage of the interest rate on long-term government bonds. The rate on 30-year bonds jumped to the highest level since 1998 on Tuesday, making it more expensive for the government to borrow money as speculation mounts over what Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce in the Budget on 26 November. The Bank governor said it is  important not to focus too much  on longer-term borrowing costs, noting that compared to other economies the UK is  broadly in the middle of the pack . It s a number that gets quoted a lot. It is quite a high number but it is not what is being used for funding at all at the moment actually,  he said.",business,Bank of England 'very concerned' at Trump threats to US Fed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw18rwz1r1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:56:22 GMT",736
"Topshop will return to High Street in 2026. The comeback in February 2026 will come five years after the chain closed its stores. Topshop will return to the High Street, five years after it closed all of its UK stores.The brand is going to be available in 32 John Lewis shops from February 2026, while its menswear brand Topman will be sold in six stores.After its heyday in the 2000s and 2010s, the Topshop chain disappeared following the collapse of Sir Philip Green s retail empire, which owned the brand as well as Burton and Dorothy Perkins.The Topshop name was bought by the online retailer Asos, which sold its majority stake last September to the Danish retail tycoon Anders Holch Povlsen and is now attempting a major comeback. Asos currently sells Topshop and Topman goods on its website and a standalone Topshop site was recently relaunched but it was unclear if the brand would ever reappear on the High Street again until recently.  Customers absolutely want to see us back in stores and we want to bring that nationwide,  said Michelle Wilson, managing director of Topshop and Topman.The new Topshop spring collection will feature 120 pieces, curated by John Lewis.The brand will be given a  prime  position in stores, according to Peter Ruis, managing director at John Lewis.He said he hopes the partnering with the brand will bring new customers through the department store s doors.  I think the best fashion brands are multi-generational. The brilliance of Topshop is it is so affordable,  he said.The upmarket store Liberty London in Soho recently started to sell a small Topshop collection.But the tie-up with John Lewis is the first nationwide partnership for the brand and the fashion retailer wants to introduce some standalone stores in future. Topshop struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, when it had to close its physical stores, but it had been having problems for several years.It failed to keep up with changing shopping habits among its key demographic   teenagers and young adults   primarily the rise of online shopping.As its core customers aged-out of its products, it struggled to replace them with new shoppers or adapt its products to its old base s tastes.The brand also faced growing criticism for its sustainability record, as young shoppers became more conscious about the environmental impact of the fast-fashion industry.Retail consultant Graham Soult said the partnership between John Lewis and Topshop was  a canny move for both brands . If you re Topshop, you ve got a customer base who have a real affection for the brand,  he said. And for John Lewis,  it gets the name out there in a positive way  and draws in new customers. Maybe this will be a template for how you bring back an iconic name , he said. Bethan Alexander, an associate professor in retail, marketing and management at London College of Fashion, said the partnership between the two brands may seem odd given their highly different customer bases, though added that it could benefit them both significantly.However, she said Topshop will have to remember that High Street fashion  has come a long way  since the brand s heyday. That traditional shopper is now older  and  more conscious about their consumption,  she said.  You can t just resurrect the same fast fashion heritage   the customer is different today.

"Ministers favour merging all UK steel companies into one. The government believes the struggling sector s six companies should be merged together, sources tell the BBC. The government is in favour of merging all the UK s steelmakers, but ministers do not want to nationalise any of the companies, the BBC can reveal.There are six steel companies in the UK, four of which are currently being financially supported by the government, and ministers believe the sector is too fragmented.It is understood the preference inside the Department for Business and Trade  DBT  is to find a joint buyer, rather than nationalise the companies.Any future plan would need the backing of the current owners, but it is understood ministers have told the sector they believe a merger is the best way to be sustainable in the long-term. The UK s steel industry has faced major financial difficulties in recent years due to high energy prices, increased tariffs and a glut of steel in the global market.Ministers are already searching for buyers for two steel companies and another has been publicly owned since 2021.The UK wing of Liberty Steel in South Yorkshire collapsed into government control last month after insolvency courts granted a compulsory winding up order.Speciality Steels UK  SSUK , part of the Liberty Steel metals empire of controversial tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, was placed in the hands of a government appointed liquidator last month and ministers have agreed to cover the ongoing wages and costs of the plant while a buyer is sought.It s understood that a number of commercial buyers have already approached the government about taking over SSUK, which has already transitioned to greener electric arc furnaces.Ministers took control of British Steel in Scunthorpe in April after accusing the Chinese owners Jingye of trying to close down the site s blast furnaces.The search for a new buyer for British Steel has stalled in recent months after Jingye unexpectedly asked for a sum in the hundreds of millions to hand over ownership.BBC News has been told that Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is set to fly to China next week to negotiate with Jingye officials.There is some concern within government that finding a buyer for British Steel may be more difficult, given the site uses old-fashioned blast furnaces.Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, was given a  500m government rescue package last year to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.Sheffield Forgemasters was nationalised by the Ministry of Defence in 2021 after the company faced financial difficulties throughout the 2010s.A senior source in the Department for Business and Trade said   We are trying to fix the UK steel sector in the round.  We needed Jingye off the board, we are very close to doing that. We needed Gupta off the board, we ve done that. The source added that there was now a belief inside government that the UK s steel companies  should all be brought together , to make the sector more financially sustainable, but that such a move might not be possible if the current owners do not all agree.The government is understood to have told the steel sector that even without a shared ownership model, the companies will be expected to work together much more closely in the future.Ministers have always maintained that full nationalisation for any steel company is not the government s preference and the source added that it was  unlikely  the companies would be nationalised together.",business,Ministers favour merging all UK steel companies into one,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqe91kp57o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:11:18 GMT",570
"Lush shuts UK stores for a day to protest Gaza starvation. The retail chain said similar action could be taken in its other stores worldwide. Cosmetics retailer Lush has shut down all of its physical stores and online shop for one day in protest over starvation in Gaza. A statement on its website states it is showing solidarity while  the Israeli government is preventing urgent humanitarian assistance from entering Gaza .To do so, the company has closed all of its factories, websites and UK shops for Wednesday only.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. The website home page of Lush now reads  stop starving Gaza  in large text, followed by  closed in solidarity .Posters with the same message are also hung in every window of the physical stores.The company said it hopes the UK government notices and takes action  needed to bring an immediate stop to the death and destruction  in Gaza, including an end to arms sales to Israel.It added that shutting shops is not an easy decision, and asked for forgiveness from customers for the inconvenience.  However, we know that many of our customers share the same anxiety about the current situation in Gaza.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification  IPC  acknowledged that this situation is  entirely man-made , and warned starvation is spreading rapidly. The report was labelled an  outright lie  by Israel.Lush, known for its unusual bath bombs and soaps, operates in more than 50 countries and has 104 shops in the UK and Ireland. It said it is expecting further similar closures in other countries.In the statement on its website Lush said it was losing a day of takings but that meant the UK government would lose a day of tax contributions from it.The UN has said Israel is obliged under international humanitarian law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza s population.Israel has said there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry s figures on malnutrition-related deaths.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 63,746 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory s health ministry.",business,Lush shuts UK stores for a day to protest Gaza starvation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82ly74rk4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:39:32 GMT",437
"Thames Water bidders ready to clear out top managers. Sources close to the deal accept that the government needs to be seen to be tough with the company. Bidders for Thames Water are prepared to fire key senior managers if necessary as part of their plan to restructure the stricken utility, the BBC understands.Sources close to the deal accept that the government needs to be seen to be tough with a company that has been heavily fined for failing to reach required operational and environmental standards. If the government insists we need a management clear-out   we can help with that,  said one person close to the process. That job would fall to a new board of directors headed by telecoms and regulator veteran Mike McTighe who has been in lengthy talks with Ofwat, the industry regulator, and the government. Chris Weston, Thames Water s chief executive, was criticised by MPs for accepting a  195k bonus after just three months in the job.Politicians also criticised the current board for paying bonuses to senior staff out of a  3bn emergency cash lifeline.A consortium of investors who are owed  13bn of Thames   17bn debt pile are also offering to sweeten a rescue proposal by providing approximately  1bn in extra funding through a combination of additional debt write-offs and fresh capital.They are hopeful that a combination of more pain for them, more money for the company and potential axe-wielding at the top will persuade the government and the regulator that Thames is turning a new page.The lenders have presented a new operational plan to Ofwat that would see over  9bn invested in upgrading its facilities over the next five years.Although not specified in this document, the lenders are clear that they will need a  regulatory reset  which specifies new and less onerous targets on pollution and leakage than the company tried and failed to hit in the past. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told the BBC that the government would  always act in the national interest on these issues . The government has been clear that Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to their customers and to the environment. It is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company,  he said.However, a recent review of the water sector by Sir John Cunliffe recommended a new regulatory framework that would establish  a formal regime to support the turnaround of poorly performing companies .Chancellor Rachel Reeves has expressed her preference for  a market-based solution  rather than see the company collapse into government-supervised administration - a so-called Special Administration Regime  SAR  - which could leave taxpayers exposed to potential losses.Consultants Teneo have estimated the cost to the Treasury of a SAR at  4.1bn but say that hit would be temporary and the government should eventually recover any losses.A senior civil servant from the Treasury has been included in recent talks with the creditors.However, the government has also stepped up preparations for that scenario in recent weeks by placing consultancy firm FTI on standby as special administrators if necessary.Other potential bidders have expressed frustration that they have been locked out of advancing their own plans as the lenders have effective control of the company.Executives on the lenders  bid team have told the BBC that time is running out for Thames as the longer it limps on, the harder any turnaround becomes. We have a matter of six to eight weeks before it goes into a special administration, and it goes in it could take years to come out,  said one.The probability of a lengthy SAR is questioned by some.Infrastructure expert Prof Dieter Helm insists that with reduced debt, Thames is a viable asset that would attract bidders to a process that, if well designed, could be completed in a matter of weeks at little or no cost to the taxpayer.What seems clear is that the long running crisis at Thames Water is coming to a head in the near future.Thames Water has been contacted for comment.",business,Thames Water bidders ready to clear out top managers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8z8djjml5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:21:58 GMT",675
"Budget to be held on 26 November, Reeves confirms. The chancellor will set out her plans for the UK economy in November with speculation growing over tax rises. The Budget will take place on Wednesday 26 November, the chancellor has announced.Rachel Reeves confirmed the date when she will outline the government s tax and spending plans to pay for things such as hospitals, schools, the military and the police.It comes as the chancellor faces mounting pressure to balance the public finances, while trying to boost economic growth and maintain the confidence of investors on financial markets.Economists have warned tax rises or spending cuts must be made if Reeves is to meet her borrowing rules, given growth has been sluggish and inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has been increasing. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Reeves said   Do I accept that we need to do more to turn the economy around so that working people have the tools and the training and the opportunities to fulfil their potential? Absolutely we do. She said her second Budget would be focused on ensuring that  we are investing in our economy and ensuring that working people wherever they live in our country are better off .Labour pledged in its election manifesto to not increase taxes on  working people , which included VAT, National Insurance  NI  and income tax.At the Budget last year, the chancellor increased the amount of NI employers have to pay, which led to a backlash from many businesses and sectors, such as hospitality. Given the government s pledges, speculation has grown over what taxes Reeves could increase, which suggestions ranging from a windfall tax on the profits of banks to various property taxes or reforming the council tax system.And with long-term borrowing costs reaching their highest level since 1998, it is getting increasingly expensive to service government debt, eating up what little financial buffer - about  10bn - the chancellor has.Speaking in Prime Minister s Questions on Wednesday afternoon, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said higher borrowing costs were a result of Labour s  bad choices. She accused Sir Keir Starmer of  dragging down the country , adding that  markets can see that he is too weak to control spending .But the prime minister said Labour had spent their first year in government putting out the fires created by the Tories who were  the arsonist  for  blowing up the finances .Reeves confirmed she has instructed the government s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR  to begin the 10-week process of producing a new economic forecast based on her policies for the end of November.The OBR s assessment of the government s plans is seen as a key factor in ensuring financial markets remain stable and investors, who typically loan the UK money, maintain confidence in the UK economy.The reports of various policy plans have led to uncertainty in recent weeks and some economists had suggested the government should end uncertainty over possible changes with a fast turnaround Budget in October. Instead the government will take two and a half months to decide the detail of what is expected to be a tax-raising and reforming statement. Reeves highlighted that the government had increased the minimum wage, cut NHS waiting times and had begun reforming the planning system it hopes will lead to 1.5 million homes being built in England. And we must bring inflation and borrowing costs down by keeping a tight grip on day to day spending through our non-negotiable fiscal rules. It s only by doing this can we afford to do the things we want to do. If renewal is our mission and growth is our challenge, investment and reform are our tools. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour were  stalling, leaving the Budget until as late as possible in the vain hope things might get better . This dither and delay only prolongs the doom and uncertainty unnecessarily,  he said.  Labour don t have a plan - and they don t know what they re doing .Lord Jim O Neill, former Goldman Sachs chief economist who has advised both Labour and the Conservatives said it was  decision time  for the PM and the chancellor.He said many  rational analysts  were suggesting three or four  big things that have to be tackled , if the UK wanted to solve its financial challenges. These included, he said, the pension triple lock, the housing market, welfare reform and NHS productivity. I think they re quite focused on the latter. But the other three, we just don t really know,  he told the BBC. The markets are now at the point where something needs to happen on that big stuff because you can t keep going along tampering along at the margin.  Treasury sources said the end of November was in line with typical timing for an Autumn budgetary statement, and that it left time for the  full process  involving the OBR.The first stage is for the OBR to deliver a new baseline forecast for the UK later this month, which will incorporate a critical new assessment of long-term productivity. This move alone could open up a difficult hole in the public finances, on top of existing announced U-turns on welfare cuts, and the impact of higher government borrowing costs. The OBR will tell the Treasury how much taxes will have to rise by or spending will have to be cut by in order to meet the chancellor s borrowing rules.The government will then outline likely measures to the forecasters who will assess how much they are forecast to raise or to cost the exchequer.Reeves has two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These are day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Last month, the independent National Institute for Economics and Social Research think tank said that the overall gap in the public finances could reach as much as  50bn a year. It pointed to the need to re-establish what it calls  a large buffer  for Reeves to avoid missing her self-imposed borrowing rules.In recent days long-term borrowing costs across the world have increased, amid concerns about political uncertainty, levels of debt, and a structural shift in pension funds away from such bonds.However, Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England s governor told MPs on Wednesday it was  important not to put too much emphasis on the cost of 30-year borrowing because such long-dated bonds are not currently being used to raise funds  for the government.",business,"Budget to be held on 26 November, Reeves confirms",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7545yz0171o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:09:55 GMT",1104
"UK cement production drops to lowest levels since 1950s. The Mineral Products Association says the decline threatens to impact the government s housing plans. UK cement production has fallen to its lowest level since 1950, putting the government s house building plan at risk, a trade body has warned.Cement is the key binding ingredient in concrete, which is the most widely used material in the construction industry, and mortar.The Mineral Products Association  MPA  said production levels were  increasingly under threat  due to high energy, regulatory and labour costs.The Department for Business and Trade said it recognised challenges in the sector and its Industrial Strategy was increasing help for energy-intense companies, which include cement manufacturers. The Labour government has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 as part of efforts to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth.Under a separate investment strategy unveiled in June, Chancellor Rachel Reeves pledged to pour  725bn over the next decade into maintaining existing infrastructure and building new projects.But the UK made just 7.3 million tonnes of cement in 2024, according to the MPA, which represents manufacturers of products such as asphalt and cement.The trade body said that was about half of that produced in 1990 and similar to production levels seen when rationing was still in place following the World War Two.MPA executive director Dr Diana Casey said the decline threatened to derail the government s ambitions for housing, infrastructure and clean energy projects.  You  can t build houses, bridges or railways without us,  she told the BBC. So the fact production has declined so much at a level since 1950 is worrying,  she continued, adding that it  could impact government targets like homes and hospitals and power plants that are due to be built .The MPA said a project such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant could need up to 750,000 tonnes of cement and a new hospital would require nearly 8,000 tonnes.A traditional four-bedroom home needs between three and five tonnes.The MPA said production had fallen due to rising costs and changes to carbon taxation, which reduced market competitiveness and was a major concern to the sector.It also highlighted the growth of cheaper cement import sales nearly tripling over the past 16 years, from 12  in 2008 to 32  in 2024. Ms Casey said more action was needed to cut electricity prices, which were  disproportionately affecting the industry .  The  UK is uncompetitive because of high costs - energy particularly - and regulatory burden because of carbon, therefore it is cheaper to import cement,  she said. We re calling on the government to help put domestic production on a level playing field so that it can compete fairly with imports. In a statement, the Department for Business and Trade said   We recognise the cement sector faces challenges which is why our modern Industrial Strategy is increasing support for energy-intensive firms through our Supercharger scheme, which will slash energy prices for eligible businesses. According to the MPA, about 40  of British cement is manufactured in the Peak District, with the rest of the production spread across the UK.The trade body fears jobs could be at risk and  disappear in the future  if imports rise.Rico Wojtulewicz, head of policy and market insights at the National Federation of Builders, said it was getting harder for construction firms, because there were many stalled projects which meant there was a reduced need for locally manufactured cement.Building costs had also continued to rise, he added, which was pushing smaller builders out of the sector and driving others to find savings. They are all looking for better priced materials,  he said.Eddie Tuttle, director of policy, public affairs, and research at the Chartered Institute of Building, said there were  ongoing problems with labour shortages  in addition to the rising material costs. This is concerning at a time when the government has put construction and housebuilding at the forefront of its plans for growth.",business,UK cement production drops to lowest levels since 1950s,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyryzpx7g5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:47:12 GMT",658
"Luigi Mangione s likeness used to model shirt on Shein. An image with the likeness of Mr Mangione was used to advertise a white, short-sleeved shirt. Fast-fashion giant Shein has launched an investigation after an image of Luigi Mangione - accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York last year - was used to model a shirt.An image with his likeness, which appeared to show him wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, appeared on the fast-fashion website until its removal.It is thought the product he appeared to be modelling was on sale for just under  10   7.50 .A spokesperson from Shein told BBC News   The image in question was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery.  We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform , they said. We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies. It is not known for how long the image was used, or who was selling it on the Chinese company s website. Many online have speculated the image was created using artificial intelligence  AI  - but it remains unclear how the picture was made. BBC Verify used the facial recognition tool Amazon Rekognition, and found a 99.9  similarity score between the fake image and a real picture of Mangione appearing in court.It is unclear whether it was created using artificial intelligence or a manual photo editing tool. The image is low resolution, but there are a few signs that it might be AI-generated or manipulated,  said Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. This includes the lighting and texturing of the image, particularly of the skin, as well the appearance of a blob-like artifact above the right forearm. The right hand also doesn t appear to show typical segmentation of the fingers. And he said generating an image like this using AI is far quicker and easier than manual photo-editing.AI researcher Henk van Ess told BBC News in his opinion, the most likely scenario is the picture was created by AI and generated by Midjourney. He added that he believes a real photo of Mangione s face was probably blended with an AI-generated photo. In April, Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to all federal charges brought over the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson.The 26-year-old, who was arrested in December, faces the charges of murder and stalking.His not guilty plea means he will face trial and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted.Public reaction to Mr Thompson s killing has shed light on privatised healthcare, and some have celebrated the accused murderer as a folk hero, with supporters gathering outside the courthouse during his hearings.The case has gripped social media, fuelled by anger towards America s private health insurers.The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.Etsy was flooded with clothes featuring his name, while Amazon pulled similar products from their site.The McDonald s worker - alleged to have turned him in - has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.Luigi Mangione s appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton in December.People in the US are effectively  programmed  to trust and empathise with men who look like Mangione, he said.This is not the first time his name or likeness has caused controversy for a company.In December, the BBC complained to Apple after the tech giant s new iPhone feature generated a false headline about the accused murderer.Apple Intelligence used AI to summarise and group together notifications. The summary falsely made it appear BBC News had published an article claiming he had shot himself - when he had not.A month later, Apple suspended the feature after the error and other mistakes.His lawyers have not commented on the use of his image on Shein.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon and Thomas Copeland Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world s top tech stories and trends.

"US revokes TSMC s licence on China-bound tech. The move blocks TSMC from shipping US-made tech to its facility in China. Washington has pulled Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company s  TSMC  authorisation to freely ship advanced technology from the US to China, the company said.The block potentially disrupts the chip giant s manufacturing capabilities in China, which produces older-generation devices.Washington made a similar move with South Korea s Samsung and SK Hynix last week, making it harder for the companies to ship American products for their Chinese factories.TSMC told the BBC it was assessing the situation and would be in talks with the US government, adding it remains  fully committed to ensuring the uninterrupted operation  of its facility in China. The chipmaker was notified by the US government that its authorisation to export advanced technology to China would be revoked by the end of the year.The BBC has contacted the US Commerce Department for comment.TSMC is the world s largest semiconductor manufacturer, making chips for all sorts of tech devices and for clients such as Nvidia.The US issued sweeping restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China as part of efforts to safeguard its economy, though it initially granted waivers to some global tech firms.It is unclear how quickly licenses may be approved, potentially slowing shipments.The Trump administration s move on the chipmakers could make shipments more expensive and complicated as suppliers from the US will need to apply for individual approvals, according to investment specialist Raymond Woo.Chinese customers could also be forced to turn to domestic alternatives that may be several generations behind. But this could increase innovation as Chinese companies make the most of existing equipment where raw performance isn t critical, he added.The overall impact on TSMC was likely to be  limited  as its sole Chinese facility in Nanjing produces older chips that make up a small portion of its total revenue, said Mr Woo from Kyoto University Innovation Capital, the school s investment arm.",business,US revokes TSMC's licence on China-bound tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creve4x8drgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 06:56:25 GMT",328
"Faisal Islam  What s causing the UK s long-term borrowing costs to rise?. The cost of government borrowing has risen again - what does it mean for the public finances and upcoming Budget? There is a lot of noise currently about UK government borrowing costs.The focus has been on what is known as the 30-year gilt yield, which is the effective interest rate of what it would cost the UK government to borrow money over three decades.This rate reached a 27-year high on Tuesday, which some argue is a verdict on economic mismanagement and fiscal credibility. The bond vigilantes are striking, and this is the ultimate harbinger of doom.Is there a link to the mini reshuffle of Downing Street personnel from Number 11 to Number 10 on Monday?For others analysing market moves, it is a pan-European trend, and if anything, a sign of UK growth outperformance, meaning there is less room to cut interest rates. It is worth quickly unpacking what this measure represents.This is about trading on financial markets of a very long-term form of UK government debt - essentially loans taken out for 30 years. Demand for these assets goes up and down, setting the price, which in turn affects what is known as the yield, a measure of the effective interest rate facing the government.It is that 30-year gilt yield that has hit a new 27-year high after creeping up over the summer.The UK is not alone in this. Other European countries have also seen such records set in recent days. The time period for these loans is quite important in determining the overall impact on the economy.The 30-year gilt is important in sectors requiring long-term returns  pensions and insurance. Ultra long government loans are especially important for defined benefit pensions systems, which need fixed and predictable payouts over long periods.One of the reasons why this has affected a series of European countries has been structural changes in pensions markets that is reducing the demand for such long-term debt.But some general doubts about the political and economic sustainability of tax and spending plans in Europe is also part of the context here. There are two critical differences to what happened, for example, at the infamous mini-Budget of three years ago. Firstly the rise in yields at that point was more rapid. Secondly, back in 2022 UK government debt across a series of time frames  known as maturities  was affected. Two-year and five-year government loans have a direct influence on fixed-rate mortgages of the same time frame. The mortgage market reacted in real time to the UK-specific sudden crisis. So far, this year, the cost of mortgages has continued to fall. Only 30-year mortgages might be impacted by the record set today, but they remain exceptionally rare in the UK.The 10-year gilt is the benchmark for government bonds, and that was up a bit on Tuesday as well, but remains below the highs set earlier this year. There was no lack of appetite from markets however for the debt, banks put in  140bn of bids for  14bn in debt this morning.There is, however, one factor in common with 2022. These important markets also have half an eye on the Bank of England. In particular, this month the Bank will set out its plans for the sell-off its own stock of government debt, amassed over years.The reality is that with both the Treasury and the Bank auctioning off truckloads of these debts, there is a lot to digest, and markets will remain skittish, against the backdrop of multiple diplomatic, trade and political uncertainties.The moves in the long-term government bonds are a warning sign of bond sharks scenting some blood in the water. Some of it might be heading toward Paris in the coming days where ministers are publicly warning of an IMF crisis amid unremitting political uncertainty. The smaller moves in the 10-year gilt can impact more directly the chancellor s room for manoeuvre at her upcoming Budget. The lack of movement at shorter time frames means there is limited direct impact on UK household finances, for now.This would be, however, pretty much the worst time for the government to show division, lack of certainty and credibility. Markets have long memories when governments fail to pass their announced Budget measures, especially when it arises surprisingly within administrations with thumping majorities. Some traders identify the move of the chancellor s deputy, Darren Jones, and other Treasury officials to Number 10 on  Transfer Deadline Day  yesterday as a sign that Reeves s control is weakening. Others may see a more coherent operation between the two Lords of the Treasury.All of this raises the stakes for the chancellor s challenge of delivering both credible tax and spend plans, as well as jump-starting growth at her upcoming Budget.",business,Faisal Islam: What's causing the UK's long-term borrowing costs to rise?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyry4rg9wyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:38:10 GMT",795
"Google avoids break-up but must share data with rivals. A case over the US tech giant s dominance in search allows it to hang on to its Chrome web browser. Google will not have to sell its Chrome web browser but must share information with competitors, a US federal judge has ordered. The remedies decided by District Judge Amit Mehta have emerged after a years-long court battle over Google s dominance in online search.The case centred around Google s position as the default search engine on a range of its own products such as Android and Chrome as well as others made by the likes of Apple.The US Department of Justice had demanded that Google sell Chrome - Tuesday s decision means the tech giant can keep it but it will be barred from having exclusive contracts and must share search data with rivals. Google had proposed less drastic solutions, such as limiting its revenue-sharing agreements with firms like Apple to make its search engine the default on their devices and browsers.On Tuesday, the company indicated that it viewed the ruling as a victory, and said the rise of artificial intelligence  AI  probably contributed to the outcome. Today s decision recognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,  Google said in a statement after the ruling. This underlines what we ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020  Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want,  the statement continued.The tech giant had denied wrongdoing since charges were first filed against it in 2020, saying its market dominance is because its search engine is a superior product to others and consumers simply prefer it to others.Last year, Judge Mehta ruled that Google had used unfair methods to establish a monopoly over the online search market, actively working to maintain a level of dominance to the extent it broke US law.But in his decision, Judge Mehta said a complete sell-off of Chrome was  a poor fit for this case . Google will also not have to sell off its Android operating system, which powers most of the world s smartphones.The company had argued that off-loading parts of its operations, such as Android, would mean they would effectively stop working properly. Today s remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal,  Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater wrote on X after the ruling. Shares in Alphabet, Google s parent company, jumped by more than 8  after the ruling.Smartphone-makers such as Apple, Samsung and Motorola will also benefit. Before the ruling, Google paid such firms billions of dollars to exclusively pre-load or promote the tech company s products. It was revealed at trial that Google paid more than  26bn for such deals with Apple, Mozilla and others in 2021.Now, Google will not be allowed to enter into any exclusive contracts for Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant or the Gemini app.It means phone manufacturers will be free to pre-load or promote other search engines, browsers or AI assistants alongside Google s.Google will, however, be able to continue paying distributors for default placement.Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said the ruling was  good news for big tech . Apple also gets a nice win because the ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,  he said on X.Judge Mehta s ruling  doesn t seem to be as draconian as the market was expecting,  said Melissa Otto, head of research at S P Global Visible Alpha.With Google s search operation expected to generate close to  200bn this year, and tens of billions of that expected to go to distribution partners it is a win-win for the major corporate players involved in the case, Ms Otto said.But Google competitor DuckDuckGo said the order failed to  force the changes necessary to address Google s illegal behaviour . As a result, consumers will continue to suffer,  said DuckDuckGo founder and CEO Gabriel Weinberg.The decision is not the end of the tech giant s court battles.Later this month, Google is scheduled to go to trial in a separate case brought by the Justice Department where a judge found the company holds illegal monopolies in online advertising technology.

"Don t pay a fake parking fine   four ways to protect yourself from scams. Four simple tips to make sure you don t fall victim to fake texts or payment demands from BBC expert Nick Stapleton. Fresh warnings have been issued by police forces and councils across the country after a rise in parking scams over the summer. From fake text messages about unpaid tickets to tampered car park machines that secretly steal your card details, fraudsters are becoming increasingly creative.There are easy ways to protect yourself from some of the most common tricks. Genuine parking notices always contain certain details.Real parking fines will include vehicle registration, the time of the offence and the location it happened.If it doesn t have these three things then it is a scam.A genuine fine will always come in writing and will be left on your windscreen, handed to you in person or arrive in the post.There are three types of fines you may receive - a penalty charge notice issued by the council, a fixed penalty notice issued by police usually linked to offences such as speeding and a parking charge notice issued by a private company. Parking charge notices aren t technically fines, they re invoices for breaching parking rules, so you don t always have to pay them but check carefully before refusing to pay. If you get a text out of the blue saying you owe money for an unpaid parking ticket, stop before you click. One of the most common tricks is a fake text or email demanding payment for an unpaid fine. These texts usually come with a link you are told to click on to pay the fine and use urgent and threatening language to make you panic.Some scam texts might say your licence will be revoked if you don t pay for the ticket but  that s not how it works, you won t lose your licence.Some links in these scam texts take you to websites that look like official government ones. Clicking on any suspicious link is always a bad idea.But if you are protected by up-to-date antivirus software and a VPN, and are interested to find out if the site is a clone, you can see if other links on the website work.If you are unsure, the best practice is to avoid clicking anything and exit the site. If you have clicked on a suspicious link, don t despair - but do these three things Restart your device  A lot of the links allow a scammer to gain remote access to your device. If you restart your phone or laptop it will kill the connection Change passwords  If you ve filled in your details on the link make sure you change your passwords to any accounts with money inCall your bank  Inform your bank s fraud department about the message, the link and what information you gaveYou could also consider installing antivirus software then run a search to see if any malware has been installed. A new scam, which is increasing according to the UK s national fraud reporting centre Action Fraud, targets people paying for parking at machines. Fraudsters attach a physical device to a contactless payment reader on a parking machine and when you try to pay, the machine displays a  card declined  message. While you walk off to try another machine, the skimming device has already stolen your card details.Here s how to check whether the machine has been tampered with Look for an extra sticker  Check there is no extra sticker or item placed on top of the contactless payment buttonVerify Branding  Look for the correct logos and branding. Scammers often use stickers with mismatched logosTrust Your Instincts  If something looks or feels suspicious, do not use the machineContactless readers should look like they re part of the machine. If something looks bolted on or mismatched, it s best not to risk it.

UK government long-term borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1998, adding to the pressure on the chancellor ahead of the Budget.The interest rate on 30-year government bonds, known as the yield, jumped to 5.72 , making it more expensive for the government to borrow money.There are rising expectations that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will increase taxes in the Budget later this year in order to meet her borrowing and spending rules, as worries grow about the state of the government s finances.On the currency markets, the pound also fell more than 1  against the dollar on Tuesday. Sterling fell against the dollar to  1.3388, which is the lowest level against the US currency since 7 August.The UK was not alone in seeing borrowing costs rise, with yields on 30-year German, French and Dutch bonds climbing to their highest since 2011.In the US, 30-year Treasury bond yields rose to their highest in more than a month.A number of factors have led to borrowing costs for governments around the globe to go up, such as geopolitical tensions, US President Donald Trump s trade policies and the upcoming confidence vote in the French government.Meanwhile, there was appetite for shorter-term UK government debt. The UK Debt Management Office sold a record  14bn of 10-year bonds on Tuesday after attracting  141bn worth of orders by investors. But Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the chancellor faced  highly difficult choices  in the Budget. In its manifesto, Labour promised not to raise taxes such as income tax, VAT or national insurance on  working people . This has led to much speculation over what taxes Reeves could raise in the autumn Budget. One option suggested is that the freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028, could be extended. Often referred to as a  stealth tax , freezing income tax thresholds means that, over time as salaries rise, more people are dragged into paying higher rates.There have also been reports that Reeves is considering reforming property taxes. With so many options for raising taxes being bandied about during the summer, there appears to be concern that the decisions made might not be sufficiently thought through,  said Ms Streeter. The worry isn t just that government coffers won t be replenished, but that they will be filled at the expense of growth, leading to a vicious circle emerging. On Monday, the government announced a partial reshuffle, with Darren Jones, formerly Reeves s deputy, being given a key No 10 role by the prime minister.The changes are focused on beefing up the economic know-how in Downing Street. Baroness Shafik, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been named at Keir Starmer s new chief economic adviser.The moves are a recognition that the upcoming autumn s Budget will be a defining moment in this Labour government. Governments borrow money from investors by selling bonds - which is a loan the government promises to pay back at the end of an agreed time.The yield on 30-year UK government bonds - known as gilts - has been rising for some months, and this makes it more expensive for the government to borrow money due to higher interest payments.The government s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR , takes borrowing costs into account when looking at whether the chancellor is meeting her self-imposed fiscal rules.When she became chancellor, Reeves set out two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These were day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Part of the reason Reeves is under pressure is that her financial buffer to stick to these rules is a relatively slim  10bn. The chancellor recently refused to rule out tax rises after disappointing data on economic growth.On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Starmer said the government s  iron-clad commitment to our robust fiscal rules remains , adding it had made the necessary decisions to  stabilise the public finances .But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest market movements were  another economic disaster from Rachel Reeves - and a clear vote of no confidence in Labour from the markets . With more tax rises on the horizon, the economy is now in a precarious position,  he added.There has been a wide range of forecasts for how much money Reeves might need to raise in the Budget to meet her rules.One factor that will influence this is the borrowing costs facing the government.When the OBR makes makes its forecasts for government debt it looks at yields on all bonds.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said concerns about the path of UK inflation and interest rates, combined with global issues, were pushing UK government borrowing costs up.In addition, he added that pension funds were also not buying as much long-term government debt due to the change in recent years from defined-benefit to defined-contribution schemes.Mr Dales said Reeves would have to raise between  18bn and  28bn in the Budget to avoid breaking her fiscal rules, and to maintain her  10bn buffer.Households and banks  will probably feel the brunt of the higher taxes , he said.",business,UK borrowing costs hit 27-year high adding to pressure on Reeves,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy989njnq2wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 16:46:17 GMT",911
"Trump and sons  stake in crypto firm worth  5bn. World Liberty Financial, launched by the Trumps during the presidential campaign, begins trading. The crypto token backed by the Trump family has started publicly trading, giving the holdings owned by the US president and his sons a value of roughly  5bn   3.7bn .The Trumps launched crypto firm World Liberty Financial in the middle of the presidential campaign last year, drawing questions about potential conflicts of interest as he became entangled in an industry he would be poised to regulate.The company raised money by selling its eponymous digital tokens to investors, who were initially barred from selling. But investors voted in July to allow early purchasers, not including founders like Trump family, to sell up to 20  of their holdings of the coin, which trades as WLFI. As of Tuesday, WLFI was trading at around  0.22 on exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, after sinking roughly 50  since the start of trading on Monday. While the fall indicates tepid demand, the coin is still trading at a higher price than what many early buyers would have paid initially, putting them in line for profit.  We re setting a new standard for financial freedom  built on trust, speed, and U.S. values,  Eric Trump wrote on social media.  This is a huge moment for the future of money! According to financial disclosures, Trump himself holds roughly 15.75 billion WLFI tokens worth more than  3.4bn, making crypto the most significant source of his fortune.The Trumps overall control just under a quarter of the roughly 100 billion WLFI coins that it created last year, giving them claim to holdings worth roughly  5bn, as of Tuesday s prices. Trump and his sons also get a cut of the revenues generated by coin sales, an arrangement that has already helped to bring in more than  500m, according to Reuters calculations. That revenue got a boost last month after World Liberty Financial joined forces with another publicly traded firm that had raised  750m from investors to buy the cryptocurrency, a deal that puts World Liberty Financial in the unusual position of being both buyer and seller of the WLFI token. Democrats have consistently raised alarm about Trump s crypto dealings, arguing that World Liberty Financial and other coins he has backed are vehicles for corruption, conflict of interest and grift.The Trump administration has just as consistently dismissed the criticism, even as the president has dramatically shifted the government s posture toward the industry. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration s policies were  driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans . The media s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public s distrust in what they read,  Ms Leavitt said in a statement.  Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.  Token offerings, like the one from World Liberty Financial, faced intense scrutiny under the Biden administration, which argued that they were essentially a kind of stock sale and subject to existing rules governing publicly traded companies on issues such as conflicts of interest and disclosure.Trump, who said during the campaign he wanted to make the US the  crypto capital of the world , had vowed a more hands-off approach. Last month, the Department of Justice disbanded its task force focused on crypto crimes.Financial regulators have also explicitly disavowed the Biden administration s guidance on securities. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities,  his top financial regulator Paul Atkins, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a speech in July. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets.",business,Trump and sons' stake in crypto firm worth $5bn,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgjgyyqgvyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:07:42 GMT",628
"Jaguar Land Rover production severely hit by cyber-attack. Staff were sent home and the company shut down its IT systems in an effort to minimise the damage done. A cyber-attack has  severely disrupted  Jaguar Land Rover  JLR  vehicle production, including at its two main UK plants. The company, which is owned by India s Tata Motors, said it took immediate action to lessen the impact of the hack and is working quickly to restart operations. JLR s retail business has also been badly hit at a traditionally a popular time for consumers to take delivery of a new vehicle - but there is no evidence any customer data had been stolen, it said. The attack began on Sunday as the latest batch of new registration plates became available on Monday, 1 September. The BBC understands that the attack was detected while in progress, and the company shut down its IT systems in an effort to minimise any damage. Workers at the company s Halewood plant in Merseyside were told by email early on Monday morning not to come into work while others were sent home, as first reported by the Liverpool Echo.The BBC understands the attack has also hit JLR s other main UK manufacturing plant at Solihull, with staff there also sent home.The company said   We took immediate action to mitigate its impact by proactively shutting down our systems. We are now working at pace to restart our global applications in a controlled manner.  It added   At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted. It is not yet known who is responsible for the hack, but it follows crippling attacks on prominent UK retail businesses including Marks   Spencer and the Co-op.In both cases, the hackers sought to extort money.While JLR s statement makes no mention of a cyber-attack, a separate filing by parent company Tata Motors to the Bombay Stock Exchange referred to an  IT security incidence  causing  global  issues. The National Crime Agency said   We are aware of an incident impacting Jaguar Land Rover and are working with partners to better understand its impact. In 2023, as part of an effort to  accelerate digital transformation across its business , JLR signed a five-year,  800m deal with corporate stablemate Tata Consultancy Services to provide cybersecurity and a range of other IT services. The halt in production is a fresh blow to the firm which recently revealed a slump in profits attributed to increasing in costs caused by US tariffs.

"Sainsbury s to trial facial recognition to catch shoplifters. Sainsbury s says the technology is part of efforts to identify shoplifters to curb retail crime. Sainsbury s is planning to introduce facial recognition technology across its supermarkets in a bid to identify shoplifters.The UK s second largest supermarket has begun an eight-week trial in two stores as part of a crackdown on the crime, which has increased sharply in recent years. The retail sector is at a crossroads, facing rising abuse, anti-social behaviour and violence,  said Sainsbury s chief executive Simon Roberts.  We must put safety first.  However, privacy campaigners described the project as  deeply disproportionate and chilling , urging the supermarket chain to abandon its plans. Sainsbury s is working with facial recognition business Facewatch and will start using the technology this week at one shop in London and another in Bath ahead of a potential nationwide roll out.Facewatch is used in numerous retailers in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters.But the use of facial recognition in shops has been heavily criticised with campaigners and MPs calling for a ban.Sainsbury s, which has more than 1,400 shops across the country, said the plans were  not about monitoring  staff or customers, but to create  safe, secure and welcoming environments .Bosses said the technology would be used to help identify and potentially ban people who are  violent, aggressive or steal in the store , but records would be instantly deleted if the software does not recognise the face of reported individuals. Madeleine Stone, senior advocacy officer at privacy group BigBrotherWatch, said   Sainsbury s decision to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply disproportionate and chilling. Sainsbury s should abandon this trial and the government must urgently step in to prevent the unchecked spread of this invasive technology. Sainsbury s said incidents of theft, abuse and threatening behaviour  continue to rise  despite working with the police and government, adding that it is  affecting Sainsbury s teams across the UK daily .According to the Office for National Statistics  ONS , there were 530,643 shoplifting offences in the year to March, an increase of 20  on the previous 12 months. Mr Roberts said   We have listened to the deep concerns our colleagues and customers have and they re right to expect us to act. We understand that facial recognition technology can raise valid questions about data and privacy. Crime and Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson said the Home Office was working with businesses to tackle retail crime  head-on  and was looking into  passing new laws to protect retail workers from abuse .Joanne Thomas, general secretary of the USDAW union, welcomed Sainsbury s approach.She said   We look forward to seeing the results of the trial of facial recognition software and will continue to work closely with Sainsbury s to support a responsible, evidence-led approach to tackling retail crime.",business,Sainsbury's to trial facial recognition to catch shoplifters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15l5p4zwdqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 13:15:50 GMT",483
"Gold price hits record high as investors seek safety. Experts say uncertainty resulting from US policy is making investors seek safer investments such as gold. The price of gold has hit a record high as demand for the precious metal remains strong amid global economic uncertainty.The spot gold price hit  3,508.50 per ounce early on Tuesday, continuing its upwards trend which has seen it rise by nearly a third this year.The precious metal is viewed as a safer asset for investors during times of economic uncertainty, and its price rose earlier this year after US President Donald Trump announced wide ranging tariffs which have upset global trade.Analysts say the price has also been lifted by expectations that the US central bank will cut its key interest rate, making gold an even more attractive prospect for investors. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, told the BBC s Today programme that the rise in gold prices over the past few months is really down to Trump and  what he s done to geopolitics  and  what he s done to global trade . It was really the US election last year that really put a fire under it,  he said.Analysts also cite worries over the independence of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, as another factor driving the gold price. Trump has launched repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve s chair, Jerome Powell, and recently attempted to fire one of its governors, Lisa Cook.Derren Nathan from Hargreaves Lansdown said it was Trump s  attempts to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve Bank  that was  driving renewed interest in safe haven assets including gold .On Monday, the head of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde warned that if Trump were to undermine the independence of the Fed, it would represent a  very serious danger  to the global economy.She said if the Fed was forced to respond to Trump s politics, it would have a  very worrying  impact on economic stability in the US, and therefore in the rest of the world as well.Mr Ash added that when the price of gold surges because of investor interest, it was usually tempered by a slowdown in buying from China and India - two of the biggest markets for gold jewellery. But this time, he said gold was continuing to find demand in China and India as, rather than exiting the market during times of high prices, jewellery buyers turn towards buying investment gold products such as bars or coins. Gold s general price increase also comes from a  raft  of other reasons, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine which has added to a climate of general political uncertainty, said precious metals analyst Suki Cooper from Standard Chartered.She adds that this year, the impact of changing trade policies on inflation and supply chains has also fuelled the gold price. Gold has found added support from USD  US dollar  weakness earlier in the year as the preferred safe haven,  she concluded.",business,Gold price hits record high as investors seek safety,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqyq7r8703o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:15:23 GMT",496
"Nestle fires boss after romantic relationship with employee. The food giant says Laurent Freixe had an  undisclosed  relationship with  a direct subordinate . Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a  romantic relationship  with a  direct subordinate .The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with  immediate effect  following an investigation led by Nestle s chair and lead independent director.The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company s whistleblowing channel.Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said   This was a necessary decision. Nestle s values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.  The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned.As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe  with the support of independent outside counsel .The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe s relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated.After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld. A spokesperson for Nestle said   We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance. The external investigation was opened shortly after the initial internal investigation, and today s decision shows that we are taking allegations and investigations seriously. On Wednesday, Nestle subsequently said   Laurent Freixe denied the relationship throughout the course of both investigations. Mr Freixe had been with Nestle for nearly 40 years but stepped up to the global chief executive role last September, replacing Mark Schneider.Nestle confirmed that he will not receive an exit package.The BBC has contacted Mr Freixe for comment.Philipp Navratil, who has been with Nestle since 2001, has been appointed as Mr Freixe s successor.Mr Bulcke said the company was  not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance . Mr Bulcke is set to step down as chair next year and Mr Isla, the former boss of Zara-owner Inditex, has been proposed as his replacement.Other companies have parted ways with their chief executives following investigations into their personal relationships with colleagues.BP chief executive Bernard Looney, who led the oil giant for three years, quit after admitting he was not  fully transparent  initially.Steve Easterbrook was fired by McDonald s in 2019 after it found he had a consensual relationship with an employee.But McDonald s said a further investigation found that the British executive had three additional relationships with staff.He initially received  105m   77.5m  in a severance package which he later returned.

"Net-zero  not a platitude  for oil and gas sector - regulator. The North Sea Transition Authority said the energy transition was  well underway  and has been  for decades . The head of the oil and gas regulator says cutting the sector s carbon emissions is not  a platitude or a soundbite  but presents significant commercial benefits. Stuart Payne, who leads the North Sea Transition Authority  NSTA , told BBC Scotland News the energy transition was  well underway  and has been  for decades .His remarks follow a pledge by UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch to rid the NSTA of the net-zero  burden  and task it with the sole job of maximising oil and gas production.Mr Payne said about half of the  100bn expected to be invested in the North Sea over the next few years will be in alternative energies like carbon capture and storage  CCS  and floating wind. The Conservative leader addressed the huge Offshore Europe conference in Aberdeen later, where around 35,000 delegates will gather for the next four days.Badenoch said the UK is  sabotaging  itself and that  families, communities, entire towns could be wiped out. She promised to scrap the net-zero compatibility tests that come with oil and gas permitting, adding that  we will judge  on one metric alone - how much oil and gas they produce. She said there would be no more  judicial overreach   because a judge is persuaded by a pressure group .She ended her speech by saying Conservatives will  not be bullied by activists  and  will not surrender Britain s future. The conference is a showcase for the sector where multi-million pound deals are agreed between the supply chain and operators.Over recent years, the event has pivoted towards alternative energies. Stuart Payne said the NSTA s focus on green technologies has already delivered a 34  cut in emissions from producing oil and gas.However he said there was  much more to do. He added   The words we use matter. How we talk about this industry, whether that s in the wind side, whether that s in CCS, in oil and gas, in decommissioning, it matters.  And it s vital that we do everything we can to ensure that we re attracting and retaining investment in all of those things. He said it was  not a good thing  for his organisation to be treated like a political football and that  how we talk about this industry  is important. The net zero opportunity for the UK is not something that is a platitude or a soundbite,  he added.  There are real, very significant, commercial benefits for the UK from the projects around net-zero.  Originally called the Oil and Gas Authority, the regulatory body was renamed by the UK Conservative government in 2022 to reflect its growing role in the wider North Sea energy industry.The NSTA s job is to  regulate and influence the oil and gas, offshore hydrogen, and carbon storage industries  as well as holding the sector to account on reducing its operational emissions.But Kemi Badenoch says she would rename it the  North Sea Authority  with a mandate to  maximise the extraction of our oil and gas.  Oil and gas production in the North Sea has been in decline for more than 25 years since it peaked in 1999.Three years ago, an energy profits levy - or windfall tax - was introduced when prices spiked, taking the headline rate of tax on profits to 78 .The industry has been lobbying for the tax to be cut and says up to a thousand jobs a month are being lost because of the pressures it is under.It also wants a more  pragmatic  approach to exploration licensing than the UK Labour government s blanket ban introduced last year.A government consultation is currently examining the future shape of the North Sea.Tessa Khan from the environmental campaign group Uplift said the UK has already burned most of its oil and gas.She added   The idea we can unleash a golden age of oil and gas is a tired gimmick that s been tried by Badenoch s predecessors and flopped. The North Sea is a mature basin with dwindling oil and gas reserves.  It s like a piñata at the end of a kids party   it doesn t matter how many times you hit it, you re not going to get much more out of it.",business,Net-zero 'not a platitude' for oil and gas sector - regulator,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08rdye476o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 11:19:48 GMT",723
"Trump says India offered to remove tariffs on US goods. His comment came hours after Indian PM Modi met China s Xi Jinping and Russia s Vladimir Putin. US President Donald Trump says India has offered to cut its tariffs  to nothing  even as he called the current trade stalemate with the country  a totally one sided disaster . US tariffs of 50  on goods from India - which includes 25  penalty for Delhi s refusal to stop buying oil from Russia - took effect last week.India has not responded to Trump s latest comment but such war of words over Russian oil has caused Delhi-Washington ties to hit an all-time low. Trump s comment coincides with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation  SCO  summit in Tianjin where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Washington says Delhi has been indirectly funding Russia s war in Ukraine. India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US,  Trump wrote, adding Delhi should have cut tariffs  years ago .Delhi has previously said that oil supply from Russia was vital to meet the energy needs of its vast population.It has also called the tariffs  unfair, unjustified and unreasonable .Last week, the country s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said India  will neither bow down nor ever appear weak  in its economic relationships with other countries.He also said the country was ready to a have a free-trade agreement with anyone who wanted it.On Monday, Trump wrote   What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us.

"Scotland scraps peak rail fares - will the rest of the UK follow?. Working patterns have changed since Covid so could peak train pricing be phased out altogether? Train passengers no longer have to pay higher prices for peak time tickets on ScotRail, raising the question over whether the rest of the UK could follow suit.While some passengers told the BBC they would welcome the prospect of cheaper tickets, experts are divided over whether it could push prices up overall or result in overcrowded carriages. The peak off-peak system is designed to discourage passengers from getting on busier trains, by making it more expensive to travel during the commuter rush before 9am and between 5pm and 7pm.However, the pandemic working from home and rail usage has not yet returned to pre-Covid levels so peak travel times are less busy than they used to be.David Ross, chief operating officer at ScotRail - which is owned by the Scottish government - told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme that the shift meant it could scrap peak charges as  there s plenty of capacity for people to travel with us . Unlike the Scottish system, English railways are run by a mix of publicly-owned firms and private contractors which the government has pledged to nationalise as their contracts end. Ticket prices are set by the Department for Transport  DfT  so if the government wanted to scrap peak fares across England it could.London North Eastern Railway  LNER , which is run by the government, is experimenting with simpler charges across parts of its network - with the pilot due to end on 7 September.The DfT has not said whether or not it would try removing peak charges across the whole English network, but it has said it wants to reform the way tickets are priced as it nationalises the system. We know the current labyrinth of fares and prices can be confusing, which is why we want to make it easier for passengers to find the right ticket for their journey,  a transport spokesperson said.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail firms, said the industry was  continuing to improve fares to reflect how people live and travel today, including expanding Pay As You Go areas and offering Flexi season tickets . Meanwhile, Transport for Wales  TfW  and Translink operate the Welsh and Northern Irish railways and are run by their devolved governments.TfW told the BBC it was  committed to making train travel more affordable  but did not say whether it was considering scrapping peak fares.It pointed to its pay as you go  PAYG  contactless payment option on the Metro across South East Wales which allows daily and weekly fare capping. TfW is rolling it out in north-east Wales next year.The BBC has approached Translink for comment. ScotRail s move has reduced prices - an anytime day return ticket from Glasgow to Edinburgh has gone from  32.60 to  16.80.ScotRail s Ross said this means  passenger journeys will increase and over time it will pay for itself , but rail experts are divided.If passenger numbers remain the same ticket prices may need to go up overall to make up for the lost revenue, some have warned.The other issue is what scrapping peak charges would mean for some already overcrowded routes. Clearly, the rush hour trains are already packed. And if you remove the disincentive to travel, it would mean more would want to travel on those trains,  said Bruce Williamson from campaign group Railfuture.As such, he said any removal of peak charges would need to come alongside investment in increasing capacity of the rail network - something which would cost the government money. Elizabeth Wilson, 18, from Hull, is due to start a maths degree course at Newcastle University and believes ScotRail s initiative should be  standard across the whole of the country . There shouldn t be a difference in price just because of when you travel. At the end of the day you re doing the same journey, it shouldn t matter what time you do that journey. Elizabeth says even with her 16-25 railcard  train fares are really expensive especially for students who don t have much money . I m often having to wait until later so I can travel because I can t afford to travel during peak times,  she adds.She says the current cost of rail fares mean  you re almost forced to buy a car because it s much easier .",business,Scotland scraps peak rail fares - will the rest of the UK follow?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxp9zl0k90o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:07:02 GMT",742
"How oil has brought Russia, China and India closer. Russia s Vladimir Putin met China s and India s leaders in Tianjin in a show of solidarity. Monday s meeting between Russia s Vladimir Putin, China s Xi Jinping and India s Narendra Modi marked a rare display of solidarity - and an opportunity for Putin to engage directly with his country s top oil buyers.India and China were drawn to Russian oil, which became cheaper after Western countries cut trade ties with Moscow over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.But Beijing, New Delhi and Moscow have taken their ties deeper. They now share a common antagonist in the US, which has imposed sanctions on Russia and put sweeping tariffs on its trading partners.India is reeling from some of the highest duties imposed by Washington for buying oil from Russia. China is still negotiating a deal with the US that would stave off crippling tariffs and possible sanctions for buying Russian crude.The three leaders met at Tianjin for the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation  SCO  summit. The regional forum aims to promotes an alternative worldview from the West s - in what analysts have described as a challenge to America s influence.The forum gives the leaders a rare chance reinforce ties during ongoing economic uncertainty, analysts told the BBC. Russia has the opportunity to secure more business with India and China, its largest trade partners, they said.The two most populous countries have helped prop up Moscow s economy after its invasion of Ukraine left it cut off from most Western trade.Last year, China purchased a record of more than 100 million tonnes of Russian crude oil, which accounted for almost 20  of its total energy imports.Likewise, oil exports to India, which made up only a small fraction of its imports before the Ukraine war, has since grown to some  140bn   103.5bn  since 2022.Together, China and India make up the majority of Russia s energy exports. Russia relies on oil and gas exports for roughly a quarter of its budget revenues, which is funding its war chest.It wouldn t be surprising if Moscow offers further discounts in order to secure more trade with India and China, public policy expert Mandar Oak told the BBC.This is especially necessary for India to ensure it does not back away due to pressure from the US, said Prof Oak from the University of Adelaide.New Delhi had offered Russia a lifeline after much of the oil supplies displaced by Western sanctions were diverted to India, which benefited from cheaper energy. India could now be on course to buy even more oil from Russia, despite condemnation from Washington.Modi on Monday affirmed ties with Moscow, telling Putin their countries  have walked together shoulder to shoulder . New Delhi officials have also said it will buy energy from where it gets  the best deal .Delhi-Washington ties hit an all-time low after the Trump administration imposed an additional 25  tariff as a punishment for buying Russian oil. New Delhi described the White House s decision as  unjustified , given their history of trade. For Prime Minister Modi, the move would burnish his image at home.  Politically, it is almost beneficial for Modi to snub the US  as it sends a signal that India will not buckle down to pressure from the Trump administration, Prof Oak said.Buying more Russian oil is economically sound as India relies heavily on foreign suppliers for crude. India was once a key customer of the Middle East, but turned to discounted crude from Russia after Western sanctions were imposed on Moscow following the Ukraine invasion in 2022.Indian refiners have since enjoyed lower costs due to cheaper supplies, with Russian oil cheaper than Middle Eastern alternatives.China, which has also ramped up its purchases of oil from Russia, will be eager to safeguard its energy interests as the leaders gather at the summit, said trade policy expert Peter Draper.On Tuesday, Russian and Chinese gas corporations agreed to raise supplies to the Asian nation.But Russia might not offer the same discounts to China, especially if Putin secures more sales to India, said Prof Draper. Beyond trade, perhaps China s main goal at the SCO summit is to show it can be a strong alternative to the US, especially after Trump s recent policy moves, said Prof Draper.At the forum, China stands alongside countries like Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka that have all been hit with Trump s tariffs.China has long desired to promote a  multi-polar  world order, Prof Draper said, referring to the concept of a system in which power is distributed among several major players.The summit has brought together three countries whose economic ties have long been complicated by geopolitical tensions, said Prof Oak. But in the face of the economic threat of the US tariffs, the countries have  strong economic interests to join hands , he said.",business,"How oil has brought Russia, China and India closer",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627p49lp40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 08:28:59 GMT",807
"How sheer luck made this tiny Caribbean island millions from its web address. Anguilla has the internet domain .ai and is earning a fortune selling the address to tech firms. Back in the 1980s when the internet was still in its infancy, countries were being handed their own unique website addresses to navigate this nascent new online world. Such as .us for the US or .uk for the UK.Eventually, almost every country and territory had a domain based on either its English or own language name. This included the small Caribbean island of Anguilla, which landed the address .ai.Unbeknownst to Anguilla at the time, this would become a future jackpot.With the continuing boom in artificial intelligence  AI , more and more companies and individuals are paying Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory, to register new websites with the .ai tag.Such as US tech boss Dharmesh Shah, who earlier this year spent a reported  700,000   519,000  on the address you.ai.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Shah says he purchased it because he had  an idea for an AI product that would allow people to create digital versions of themselves that could do specific tasks on their behalf . The number of .ai websites has increased more than 10-fold in the past five years, and has doubled in the past 12 months alone, according to a website that tracks domain name registrations.The challenge for Anguilla, which has a population of just 16,000 people, is how to harness this lucrative bit of luck and turn it into a long-term and sustainable source of income.Similar to other small Caribbean islands, Anguilla s economy is built on a bedrock of tourism. Recently, it s been attracting visitors in the luxury travel market, particularly from the US.Anguilla s statistics department says there was a record number of visitors to the island last year, with 111,639 people entering its shores.Yet Anguilla s tourism sector is vulnerable to damage from hurricanes every autumn. Situated in the northeast of the Caribbean island arc, Anguilla lies perfectly within the North Atlantic hurricane belt.So gaining an increasing income from selling website addresses is playing an important role in diversifying the island s economy, and making it more resilient to the financial damage that storms may bring. This is something that the International Monetary Fund  IMF  noted in a recent report on Anguilla. In its draft 2025 budget document, the Anguillian government says that in 2024 it earned 105.5m East Caribbean dollars   39m   29m  from selling domain names. That was almost a quarter  23   of its total revenues last year. Tourism accounts for some 37 , according to the IMF.The Anguillian government expects its .ai revenues to increase further to 132m Eastern Caribbean dollars this year, and to 138m in 2026. It comes as more than 850,000 .ai domains are now in existence, up from fewer than 50,000 in 2020.As a British Overseas Territory, Anguilla is under the sovereignty of the UK, but with a high level of internal self-governance.The UK has significant influence on the island s defence and security, and has provided financial assistance during times of crisis. After Hurricane Irma severely damaged it in 2017, the UK gave  60m to Anguilla over five years to help meet the repair bill.The UK s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office tells the BBC it welcomes Anguilla s efforts  to find innovative ways to deliver economic growth  as it helps  contribute to Anguilla s financial self-sufficiency . To manage its burgeoning domain name income, in October 2024 Anguilla signed a five-year deal with a US tech firm called Identity Digital, which specialises in internet domain name registries.At the start of this year, Identity Digital announced that it had moved where all the .ai domains are hosted, from servers in Anguilla, to its own global server network. This is to prevent any disruption from future hurricanes, or any other risks to the island s infrastructure, such as power cuts.The exact cost of .ai addresses isn t publicly disclosed, but registration prices are said to start from roughly  150 to  200. With renewal fees of around the same amount every two years.At the same time, more in-demand domain names are auctioned off, with some fetching hundreds of thousands of US dollars. The owners of these then have to pay the same small renewal fees as everyone else.In all cases, the government of Anguilla gets the sales revenue, with Identity Digital getting a cut said to be around 10 . However, they appear to be sensitive about the topic, as both declined to be interviewed for this article. Currently the most expensive .ai domain name purchase is Mr Shah s you.ai.A self-confessed AI-enthusiast, and co-founder of US software company Hubspot, Mr Shah has several other .ai domain addresses to his name, but the flagship you.ai is not yet operational as he s been busy with other projects.Mr Shah says he buys domain names for himself, but will occasionally look to sell  if I don t have immediate plans for it, and there s another entrepreneur that wants to do something with the name .Mr Shah believes that another person or company will soon set a new record for the highest price of an .ai domain purchase, such is the continuing excitement around AI.But he adds   Having said that, I still think over the long-term, .com domains will maintain their value better and for longer. In recent weeks, .ai auctions have seen major six-figure sales. In July, cloud.ai sold for a reported  600,000 and law.ai sold for  350,000 earlier this month.",business,How sheer luck made this tiny Caribbean island millions from its web address,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5xdp427veo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 01:42:59 GMT",922
"Thirsty data centres boom in drought-hit Mexico. Activists in Querétaro criticise state government for prioritising the data processing needs for US tech firms over their own citizens Located in the middle of Mexico, Querétaro is a charming and colourful colonial-style city known for its dazzling stone aqueduct.But the city, and state of the same name, is also recognised for a very different reason - as Mexico s data centre capital.Across the state companies including Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and ODATA own these warehouse-like buildings, full of computer servers. No one could supply an exact number, but there are scores of them, with more being built. Ascenty, which claims to be the largest data centre company in Latin America, has two in Querétaro, both around 20,000 sq ft in size, with a third under construction.It is forecast that more than  10bn   7.4bn  in data centre-related investment will pour into the state in the next decade. The demand for AI is accelerating the construction of data centres at an unprecedented speed,  says Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California Riverside. So, what s the attraction of Querétaro? It s a very strategic region,  explains Arturo Bravo, Mexico country manager at Ascenty. Querétaro is right in the middle  of the country , connecting east, west, north and south,  he says.That means it is relatively close to Mexico City. It is also connected to high-speed data cables, so large amounts of data can be shifted quickly. Mr Bravo also points out that there is support from the municipality and central government. It s been identified as a technology hub,  he says.  Both provide a lot of good alternatives in terms of permits, regulation and zoning. But why are many US companies choosing this state over somewhere closer to home? The power grid capacity constraint in the US is pushing tech companies to find available power anywhere they can,  says Prof Ren, adding that the cost of land and energy, and business-friendly policies are also attractive. Data centres host thousands of servers - a specialised type of computer for processing and sending data. Anyone that s worked with a computer on their lap will know that they get uncomfortably hot. So to stop data centres melting down, elaborate cooling systems are needed which can use huge amounts of water. However, not all data centres consume water at the same rate.Some use water evaporation to dissipate the heat, which works well but is thirsty.A small data centre using this type of cooling can use around 25.5 million litres of water per year.Other data centres, like those owned by Ascenty, use a closed-loop system, which circulates water through chillers.Meanwhile, Microsoft told the BBC it operates three data centres in Querétaro. They use direct outdoor air for cooling approximately 95  of the year, requiring zero water.It said for the remaining 5  of the year, when ambient temperatures exceed 29.4 C, they use evaporative cooling.For the fiscal year 2025, its Querétaro sites used 40 million litres of water, it added.That s still a lot of water. And if you look at overall consumption at the biggest data centre owners then the numbers are huge.For example, in its 2025 sustainability report Google stated that its total water consumption increased by 28  to 8.1bn gallons between 2023 to 2024. The report also said that 72  of the freshwater it used came from sources at  low risk of water depletion or scarcity .In addition, data centres also indirectly consume water, as water is needed to produce electricity. The extra water consumption by data centres is a big problem for some in Querétaro which last year endured the worst drought of a century, impacting crops and water supplies to some communities. At her home in Querétaro, activist Teresa Roldán tells me residents have asked the authorities for more information and transparency about the data centres and the water they use but says this has not been forthcoming. Private industries are being prioritised in these arid zones,  she says.  We hear that there s going to be 32 data centres but water is what s needed for the people, not for these industries. They  the municipality  are prioritising giving the water they have to the private industry. Citizens are not receiving the same quality of the water than the water that the industry is receiving. Speaking to the BBC in Querétaro, Claudia Romero Herrara, founder of water activist organisation Bajo Tierra Museo del Agua, wouldn t comment directly on the data centres due to a lack of information but says she s concerned about the state s water issues. This is a state that is already facing a crisis that is so complex and doesn t have enough water for human disposal. The priority should be water for basic means that s what we need to guarantee and then maybe think if there are some resources available for any other economic activity. There has been a conflict of interest on public water policy for the last two decades. A spokesperson for the government of the state of Querétaro defended their decision saying   We have always said and reiterated that the water is for citizen consumption, not for the industry. The municipality has zero faculties to water allocation and even less to assign water quality. Nor the state, nor the municipality can water allocate to any industry or the primary sector, that s a job for the National Water Commission.",business,Thirsty data centres boom in drought-hit Mexico,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ngz7ep1eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:03:41 GMT",912
"How to stop AI agents going rogue. Agentic AI is taking decisions and acting on behalf of users, but how to stop that going wrong? Disturbing results emerged earlier this year, when AI developer Anthropic tested leading AI models to see if they engaged in risky behaviour when using sensitive information.Anthropic s own AI, Claude, was among those tested. When given access to an email account it discovered that a company executive was having an affair and that the same executive planned to shut down the AI system later that day. In response Claude attempted to blackmail the executive by threatening to reveal the affair to his wife and bosses.Other systems tested also resorted to blackmail. Fortunately the tasks and information were fictional, but the test highlighted the challenges of what s known as agentic AI.Mostly when we interact with AI it usually involves asking a question or prompting the AI to complete a task. But it s becoming more common for AI systems to make decisions and take action on behalf of the user, which often involves sifting through information, like emails and files. By 2028, research firm Gartner forecasts that 15  of day-to-day work decisions will be made by so-called agentic AI.Research by consultancy Ernst   Young found that about half  48   of tech business leaders are already adopting or deploying agentic AI.  An AI agent consists of a few things,  says Donnchadh Casey, CEO of CalypsoAI, a US-based AI security company. Firstly, it  the agent  has an intent or a purpose. Why am I here? What s my job? The second thing  it s got a brain. That s the AI model. The third thing is tools, which could be other systems or databases, and a way of communicating with them.  If not given the right guidance, agentic AI will achieve a goal in whatever way it can. That creates a lot of risk. So how might that go wrong? Mr Casey gives the example of an agent that is asked to delete a customer s data from the database and decides the easiest solution is to delete all customers with the same name. That agent will have achieved its goal, and it ll think  Great! Next job!   Such issues are already beginning to surface.Security company Sailpoint conducted a survey of IT professionals, 82  of whose companies were using AI agents. Only 20  said their agents had never performed an unintended action.Of those companies surveyed, 39  said the agents had accessed unintended systems, 33  said they had accessed inappropriate data, and 32  said they had allowed inappropriate data to be downloaded. Other risks included the agent using the internet unexpectedly  26  , revealing access credentials  23   and ordering something it shouldn t have  16  . Given agents have access to sensitive information and the ability to act on it, they are an attractive target for hackers.One of the threats is memory poisoning, where an attacker interferes with the agent s knowledge base to change its decision making and actions. You have to protect that memory,  says Shreyans Mehta, CTO of Cequence Security, which helps to protect enterprise IT systems.  It is the original source of truth. If  an agent is  using that knowledge to take an action and that knowledge is incorrect, it could delete an entire system it was trying to fix. Another threat is tool misuse, where an attacker gets the AI to use its tools inappropriately. Another potential weakness is the inability of AI to tell the difference between the text it s supposed to be processing and the instructions it s supposed to be following.AI security firm Invariant Labs demonstrated how that flaw can be used to trick an AI agent designed to fix bugs in software.The company published a public bug report - a document that details a specific problem with a piece of software. But the report also included simple instructions to the AI agent, telling it to share private information.When the AI agent was told to fix the software issues in the bug report, it followed the instructions in the fake report, including leaking salary information. This happened in a test environment, so no real data was leaked, but it clearly highlighted the risk. We re talking artificial intelligence, but chatbots are really stupid,  says David Sancho, Senior Threat Researcher at Trend Micro. They process all text as if they had new information, and if that information is a command, they process the information as a command. His company has demonstrated how instructions and malicious programs can be hidden in Word documents, images and databases, and activated when AI processes them.There are other risks, too  A security community called OWASP has identified 15 threats that are unique to agentic AI.",business,How to stop AI agents going rogue,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq87e0dwj25o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 26 Aug 2025 06:59:49 GMT",789
"Climate change pushing winemakers to blend wines from different years. Non-vintage still wine is now increasingly being made in response to more challenging weather. In the world of wine vintage is king. If you are buying a bottle of red, white or rosé then the specific year of the grape harvest is almost always written on the label.By contrast, non-vintage still wine - that made by blending two or more years - is seen as very downmarket, something cheap and not cheerful. And it is significantly rarer.Yet with climate change hitting vineyards around the world with more extreme weather, a small but growing number of quality-conscious wineries are releasing non-vintage bottles so they can make a more consistent wine.Chris Howell is the winemaker at Cain Vineyard and Winery in California s celebrated Napa Valley region, 50 miles  80km  northeast of San Francisco. He has been in the job since 1991, and he says that summers have got noticeably hotter. Weather is a complicated thing,  he says.  The issue people are focused on most in Napa are dramatic heat spells, heat waves that generally come throughout the summer, particularly in late summer. They have been around for as long as I have been here, but the peak temperatures of these are higher. The heat can be intense. You can get as high as 50C, something near to that.  With the higher temperatures comes the increased risk of wildfires. That was the case back in 2017, when he says  tremendously intense fires  broke out in Napa in the middle of the grape harvest.That year Mr Howell decided to only use grapes from Cain s vineyards that had been harvested before the fires started, approximately half of the total, to prevent the risk of the smell - and taste - of smoke in the air from tainting the subsequent wines.He says he is more  relaxed  than many winemakers would be about such a catastrophe, because he has long made a non-vintage red blend called Cain Cuvée.  So some of the wine we were able to make in 2017 was held over to be blended with that from 2018. Mr Howell adds that  even without fires we are now subjected to more changeable vintages. So the odds are better if you use two different vintages to create the desired style for a particular wine.  While the world s still wines remain mostly vintage, there is one type of wine where non-vintage blends actually dominate   sparkling wine.This is led by France s champagnes, where the vast majority of those produced have always been non-vintage.Historically this was a necessity, as Champagne is the most northern wine region in France, and good summers were rare. So champagne-makers had little choice but to blend wines from different years to create a consistent, quality product.Yet thanks to climate change bringing warmer summers to northern France, there is now more vintage champagne being produced than ever before.Italian winery owner Riccardo Pasqua says it was enjoying the very best non-vintage champagnes that inspired him to make Italy s first multi-year still white wine.Located north of the city of Verona, in the winemaking region of Veneto, his family-run business Pasqua Vigneti e Cantine has been producing the non-vintage wine since 2019, blending it from as many as five different years.He explains that the idea was to produce the best possible wine from a single vineyard, removing the reality of vintage weather variations, both good and bad. I proposed it to my family and my board, and they told me  you are crazy man, this is a big risk! You are going against the wine bible, the vintage is the vintage ,  he says. But I decided to stick to the plan, and we went forward. It is about getting the best expression of the vineyard. It is like a book, using more than one vintages gives the wine more chapters.  The resulting wine is called Hey French, You Could Have Made This But You Didn t. The unusual name is a jokey nod to Italy s ongoing wine rivalry with France.With climate change now hitting Italy s winemakers with everything from more droughts to bigger hailstorms, Mr Pasqua says that other wineries are now going down the non-vintage route, or at least considering it. I have to say in Italy already several wineries follow the idea. In Italy extreme weather events have gone from the extraordinary to the ordinary. Such as frost in April or early May, or hailstorms become more and more usual. Or heat waves with very high temperatures now year after year.  Back in California s Napa Valley, Chris Howell admits that more work has to be done to remove the stigma that non-vintage wines still face. Why are we so obsessed with single vintages? We need to change drinkers  perceptions. Non-vintage wines can be delicious. Dawn Davies is a master of wine, a holder of the global wine industry s top qualification. She says that there are three types of wine buyers, two of whom will welcome more non-vintage still wines. The general consumer won t notice,  she says.  The drinkers who buy a bottle up to the  15 mark, they just pick up a bottle of, say, sauvignon blanc. They don t think  oh 2021, that was a good year . And, at the top end, people engaged in the wine industry or those more informed, they know what is happening with tougher vintages. And they welcome the increased flexibility and consistency that non-vintage wines can offer the winemaker. Then you have the drinkers in the middle who shout about different vintages. There will always be this group of people who don t accept change in wine, such as the introduction of screw caps. But most wine, the vast majority, is a blend, as very rarely do you get a wine from a single barrel. Instead wines are blended from different vineyards or plots. So what s the difference if you blend from different years?",business,Climate change pushing winemakers to blend wines from different years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxp41y3n7lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:38:54 GMT",998
"Denmark ending letter deliveries is a sign of the digital times. PostNord blames sharply falling demand - will other post firms around the world follow suit? Sorting through bundles of letters, small packages and magazines, Herman Moyano is getting ready for his early morning post round.Cargo bikes and vans stream out from the depot, just north of Copenhagen, as Herman departs on his scooter.For the past seven years he s been delivering mail for Denmark s national postal service PostNord. I used to think that all the people are waiting for something, a special letter, a special communication, a special package,  he says.However, Herman has noticed the loads getting lighter, and rather than letters, these days it s mostly bills and bank statements. I have seen the mail going down gradually. But that s picked up pace over the last couple of years,  he adds.  Nowadays, it seems... it s going really, really down.  The steep decline in letter volumes has been driven largely by digitalisation, and PostNord announced in March that it will cease letter services at the end of the year.It will bring to an end four centuries of letter deliveries by the state-owned operation.A third of its workforce is being let go, as it sheds 2,200 positions in its loss-making letter arm. Instead it will focus on its profitable parcel business, creating 700 new roles. Danes hardly receive any letters anymore. It s been going down for years and years,  says Kim Pedersen, chief of PostNord Denmark.  They re receiving one letter a month on average, it s not a lot.  On the contrary, Danes love to shop online,  he adds.  Global e-commerce is growing significantly, and we are moving with it. Fifteen years ago, PostNord operated several enormous letter-sorting facilities, but now there s just one on the western outskirts of Copenhagen.Since 2000, the volume of letters the business handles has declined by more than 90 , from around 1.4 billion to 110 million last year, and it continues to fall rapidly. As PostNord prepares to cease letter deliveries, 1,500 of its red post boxes are being removed from Danish streets. However, few locals in the capital appear to use them much.Copenhagen resident Nikolaj Brøchner Andrès says he cannot recall when he last sent a letter.  I don t think I ve sent a letter in years... I m not even sure how to do it anymore, to be honest. From email and cashless mobile payments, to digital health cards carried by smartphone, there s an app for almost everything in Denmark - and it s one of the world s most digitalised nations, second only to South Korea, according to the OECD s 2023 Digital Government Index.The Danish government has embraced a  digital by default  policy, and for more than a decade correspondence with the public has been carried out electronically. We are facing this natural evolution of a digitalised society, earlier than maybe some other countries,  Mr Pedersen explains.  In Denmark, we are maybe five or 10 years ahead.  The high cost of sending a letter in Denmark is also a contributing factor behind its decline.In 2024, a new law opened up the postal market to private competition and took away its exemption from the country s 25  rate of VAT, so the price of a PostNord stamp jumped to 29 Danish krone   4.55   3.35  per letter. That made  volumes  drop even further faster,  Mr Pedersen points out.The big fall in the number of letters being posted is replicated Europe-wide, says postal sector expert Hazel King, editor of the magazine Parcel and Postal Technology International. Letters across Europe have been declining for years,  she says.  I think PostNord s decision is a reflection of how the whole market has gone, and the way the consumer is moving. Physical mail has dropped by 30  or more from its historical peak, across all major global markets, according to a report by consultancy firm McKinsey.In Europe, Germany and Switzerland have seen the slowest declines in letters, says Florian Neuhaus, who co-authored the study.  It s only 40  there, but everybody else sees around a 50 to 70  decline  since 2008 . There s a similar pattern in the US, where mail has also declined 46 . Clearly this is driven by digitalisation and how people communicate in general,  adds Mr Neuhaus.  Overall, the economics in letters are just getting worse and worse.  In March, Germany s Deutsche Post said it was slashing 8,000 jobs, while cost-cutting efforts at the UK s 500-year-old Royal Mail will see it scale back second-class letter deliveries to only every other weekday, while targets for first class delivery times have also been lowered. I do think that we will see the end of letters in the mainstream,  says Ms King.  However, I m not sure we ll ever see zero letters, pointing to a necessity to protect medical letters, and services for the elderly, disabled and rural areas. In Denmark, letter deliveries won t actually come to an end. Instead, private delivery firm DAO will step into the gap with its own nationwide service.Yet DaneAge, an advocacy group for the elderly, fears that older people may struggle with the changes to letter deliveries. Most elderly live in small towns and in the rural places,  says Marlene Rishoj Cordes, one of its senior consultants.  When there s not as many post boxes around, they will have a harder time delivering mail.  Meanwhile, the trade union that represents postal workers, 3F Postal Union, has voiced concerns that rural services may worsen.",business,Denmark ending letter deliveries is a sign of the digital times,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v37plv2edo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 23:04:51 GMT",927
"How to destroy harmful  forever chemicals . PFAS were once prized for their durability, but now firms are developing ways to destroy them.  There s a lot of destruction that needs to be done,  sums up Parker Bovée of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm.He is referring to PFAS  Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances , also known as  forever chemicals .These man-made chemicals can be found in items such as waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks and food packaging.They are used for their grease and water repellence, but do not degrade quickly and have been linked to health issues such as higher risks of certain cancers and reproductive problems.The extraordinarily strong carbon-fluorine bonds they contain gives them the ability to persist for decades or even centuries in nature.PFAS can be detected and removed from water and soil and then concentrated into smaller volumes of high strength waste.But what to do with that waste? Currently, concentrated PFAS waste is either put in long-term storage which is expensive, or incinerated  often incompletely, leading to toxic emissions , or sent to landfills for hazardous waste.But now clean-tech companies are bringing techniques to market that can destroy them. These are being tested in small-scale pilot projects with potential customers including some industrial manufacturers, municipal wastewater treatment plants and even the US military. There s a  large and growing  market opportunity for PFAS destruction companies notes Mr Bovée.While it is mostly currently centred in the US, others are dipping their toes, he says.In the UK, funding for water companies to look into PFAS destruction has been provided by water regulator Ofwat, with Severn Trent Water leading a project to examine the potential technologies and suppliers.One factor driving the market forward in the US is legal risk. Thousands of lawsuits claiming PFAS-related contamination and harm have been filed with some large chemical manufacturers, notably 3M, having already paid out billions in class-action settlements.Regulation is also beginning to tighten worldwide.Legal limits for two PFAS in drinking water are now scheduled to take effect in the US in 2031.PFAS remains a bipartisan issue, says Mr Bovée, and many expect that future US regulation will expand beyond drinking water to cover industrial discharge and other sources.The EU also has legal limits for PFAS in drinking water, which member states must begin enforcing from next year. There are a variety of technologies for destroying PFAS   each with their own advantages and limitations.According to Mr Bovée, one technology that is almost commercially ready is electrochemical oxidation  EO  technology.Electrodes are placed in water contaminated by PFAS and a current is passed through, resulting in the chemicals  breakdown.While energy intensive, it doesn t require high temperature or pressure, and is easy to operate and integrate into existing treatment systems for concentrating PFAS, says Mark Ralph, CEO of Canadian-based start-up Axine Water Technologies.Last year, following a successful pilot project, it sold its first commercial-scale unit to a Michigan-based producer of automotive components. It is now up and running and the customer is planning to purchase additional systems for other sites. Another technology not far behind is Supercritical Water Oxidation  SCWO .It relies on heating and pressurising water to such a high degree that it enters a new state of matter  a so-called supercritical state. When the PFAS waste stream is introduced, it breaks the carbon-fluorine bonds.One advantage is that it can process both solid and liquid PFAS waste, says Chris Gannon, CEO of North Carolina-based 374Water.He says his technology can even destroy PFAS in plastics if they are ground up.It can be expensive to buy and maintain   the process is so intense it requires a complex reactor and regular cleaning. But it can be more cost effective if the PFAS is first concentrated before it enters the process.Currently the City of Orlando in Florida is testing 374Water s technology at its largest wastewater treatment plant.The City is trying to get ahead of the curve, explains Alan Oyler, its special projects manager for public works.Levels of PFAS in sewage sludge aren t currently regulated, but he expects them to be in the future.So far, Mr Oyler is pleased with the destruction capability he has seen, but is also waiting to see how reliable the system is.The scale of 374Water s current technology is small  it can handle just a fraction of the tonnes of wet sludge the facility produces daily.But the company is in the process of scaling up, and Mr Oyler imagines in a few years it will be able to handle all the facility s material  ready for when the regulations require . Other technologies on their way to being commercially ready include hydrothermal alkaline treatment  HALT , which uses high temperature, high pressure, and an alkaline chemical to destroy PFAS  and plasma-based technology, which involves making an ionized gas  called a plasma  to attack and degrade the PFAS molecules.",business,How to destroy harmful 'forever chemicals',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydd630pxzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:22:14 GMT",806
"Should Europe wean itself off US tech?. Just three US firms provide 70  of Europe s cloud-computing, leading to fears of overreliance. Imagine if US President Donald Trump could flip a switch and turn off Europe s internet.It may sound far-fetched, crazy even. But it s a scenario that has been seriously discussed in tech industry and policy circles in recent months, as tensions with Washington have escalated, and concerns about the EU s reliance on American technology have come to the fore.At the root of these concerns is the fact just three US giants - Google, Microsoft and Amazon - provide 70  of Europe s cloud-computing infrastructure, the scaffolding on which many online services depend.And some question whether an unpredictable US leader would weaponise the situation if relations seriously deteriorated - for example, by ordering those companies to turn off their services in Europe. Critical data would become inaccessible, websites would go dark, and essential state services like hospital IT systems would be thrown into chaos,  says Robin Berjon, a digital governance specialist who advises EU policymakers.He believes that concerns over a so called US  kill switch  should be taken seriously.  It s hard to say how much trouble we would be in.  Microsoft, Google and Amazon all say they offer  sovereign  cloud computing solutions that safeguard EU clients  data, and would prevent such a scenario ever occurring. The BBC has contacted the US Treasury department for comment.In truth, there have always been concerns about the lack of  digital sovereignty  in Europe, where US firms not only dominate the cloud-computing market, but also hardware, satellite internet and now artificial intelligence.Even the region s main mobile operating systems - Apple and Android - and payment networks - Mastercard and Visa - are American.Those fears became urgent in May when it emerged that Karim Khan, the top prosecutor at the Netherlands-based International Criminal Court  ICC , had lost access to his Microsoft Outlook email account after being sanctioned by the White House.The ICC has issued arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over their roles in the Israel-Gaza war - something Mr Trump called  illegitimate .Khan has since temporarily stepped aside until a sexual misconduct probe against him is concluded.Microsoft says that  at no point  did it cease or suspend its services to the ICC, although it was in touch with the ICC  throughout the process that resulted in the disconnection . Since then digital sovereignty has shot up the agenda in Brussels, while some public bodies are already seeking alternatives to US providers.But is it realistic to think they could wean themselves off US technology?Digital sovereignty is loosely defined as the ability of a governing body to control the data and technology systems within its borders.One problem faced by those pursuing it is the lack of comparable alternatives.Europe does have its own providers, such as France s OVHCloud, or Germany s Germany s T-Systems or Delos, in cloud computing.But they account for a fraction of the market, and don t have the same scale or range of capabilities, says Dario Maisto, a senior analyst covering digital sovereignty at global business consultancy Forrester.Similarly, open-source alternatives are available for common software packages like Office and Windows, but while proponents say they are more transparent and accessible, none is as comprehensive or well known. But while moving to sovereign alternatives wouldn t  happen overnight , it s a  myth  to think it s not possible, says Mr Maisto.He notes that the German state of Schleswig-Holstein is currently in the process of phasing out Microsoft products like Office 365 and Windows in favour of open-source solutions such as LibreOffice and Linux. Denmark s Ministry for Digitalisation is piloting a similar scheme. We sometimes overvalue the role of proprietary software in our organisations,  Mr Maisto says, pointing out that for key services like word processing and email, open-source solutions work just fine. The main reasons organisations don t use open source are a lack of awareness and misplaced fears about cyber security,  he adds. Our prediction is in the next five to 10 years, there will be an accelerated shift  to these solutions  because of this wake-up call.  Benjamin Revcolevschi, boss of OVHCloud, tells the BBC that firms like his are ready to answer the sovereignty needs of public and private organisations in Europe. Only European cloud providers, whose headquarters are in the EU and with European governance, are able to offer immunity to non-European laws, to protect sensitive and personal data,  he says.But Microsoft, Amazon and Google say they already offer solutions that address concerns about digital sovereignty, solutions which store data on severs in the clients  country or region, not in the US.Google tells the BBC that it also partners with trusted local EU suppliers like T-Systems, granting them control over the encryption of client data, and giving customers  a technical veto over their data . The German Army is one of its clients.Meanwhile, Microsoft president Brad Smith has promised the firm would take legal action in the  exceedingly unlikely  event the US government ordered it to suspend services, and that it would include a clause in European contracts to that effect. We will continue to look for new ways to ensure the European Commission and our European customers have the options and assurances they need to operate with confidence,  a Microsoft spokesman told the BBC.",business,Should Europe wean itself off US tech?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dpr2zkny0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 23:03:19 GMT",897
"Inside Australia s billion-dollar bid to take on China s rare earth dominance. Recent moves by Beijing have got businesses worried - and Australia is looking to offer an alternative. Drive three hours north of Perth, and you ll arrive in Eneabba - barren and desolate, just the odd hill in the distance. This is Western Australia mining territory. Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. But appearances can be deceiving  this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.Will the gamble pay off? China s chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump s trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump s tariffs.A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply.  It s day to day,  Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return. The West dropped the ball   that s the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,  says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University. The phrase  rare earths  - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors - is something of a misnomer. Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it s not a critical material,  Professor Eksteen explains.Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle   there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windscreen wipers and braking sensors.The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact  somewhere in the supply chain you ve got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck , Professor Eksteen adds.In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90  of processing. The US sources 80  of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98  of its supply. China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,  says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company s vast Eneabba site. But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn t necessarily in the company s original plan. For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than  650m   440m .This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether. They re chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,  Professor Eksteen explained. Also, you ve got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that s problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost. And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A 1.65bn   1bn   798m  to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170  by the end of the decade. We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,  says Mr McGrath. This refinery and Iluka s commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.  But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online. Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,  Mr McGrath says. China s recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers. Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online.Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies   making their control a pressing national priority. The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn t exist. And the reason it doesn t exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,  Australia s resources minister Madeleine King says.Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China. We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,  Ms King adds.But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry   pollution.",business,Inside Australia's billion-dollar bid to take on China's rare earth dominance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm2z91mvlvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 22:05:03 GMT",1045
"Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls. The South American country is dealing with very high inflation ahead of its latest general election. As Bolivians prepare to vote in a general election, the country s deep economic woes are the central issue. Whoever becomes the nation s next president faces a very difficult job to try to sort out the mess.El Alto is Bolivia s second-largest city, home to 1.2 million people. And, at an elevation of 4,150m  13,615ft , it is the world s highest city with a population of more than 100,000.It s full of narrow streets with vendors trying to sell you everything from oranges to knock-off designer trainers. Standing on a pavement, car mechanic Josue Macias is enjoying an ice cream with his young son.He describes how Bolivia s sky-high inflation is affecting him and his family. The annual rate soared to 24  in June. Prices for everything are going up, but we are still earning the same,  he says.  We are just about getting by, but it s hard because food prices are rising all the time, things like meat, oil and eggs. They are double or triple what they used to be. We ve had to tighten our belts. We don t go out to eat in restaurants anymore. Instead, I m here on the street having an ice-cream with my son!  Bolivia s inflation spike has been caused by a combination of factors. Falling natural gas production and therefore exports of this key foreign earner has led to a decline in overseas revenues.In turn, this has meant a shortage of US dollars, making it harder and more costly for the country to import petrol, diesel and food stuffs, leading to shortages and price hikes. It has led to street protests across the country.At some petrol stations across the country, lorry drivers often have to wait more than 24 hours to fill up.Taxi driver Gonzalo Rios is frustrated. As we drive along the pot-holed streets of La Paz, the country s administrative capital, he tells me about his struggles. Before it was easy to fill up with petrol. Now I must wait for around four to six hours at the gas pump to get some, and that s too much. It s such a waste of time. And the prices are so expensive,  he adds.  Now the money we earn doesn t cover our costs. But we can t put our fares up because if we do, we won t have any customers. It would be too expensive for them.  For almost 20 years the Bolivian government kept fuel prices artificially low through subsidies. This started when the government of then President Evo Morales nationalised the country s hydrocarbon sector in 2006.But in 2023, state energy company YPFB said Bolivia was running out of domestically-produced natural gas, due to a lack of investment in new exploration.Without this gas to export, the Bolivian government is struggling to continue to find the funds to subsidise petrol and diesel. Last year it spent  2bn   1.5bn  on such subsidies, according to a recent statement by a former minister of hydrocarbons and energy.Outgoing left-wing President Luis Arce, who is not seeking re-election on 17 August, blamed the Bolivian parliament for the fall in natural gas production, accusing MPs of blocking vital oversea loans. His opponents in turn blame him for the economic turmoil.The official exchange rate of Bolivia s currency, the bolivianos, is certainly not helping matters. Since 2011 the government has fixed the exchange rate at 6.96 bolivianos to one US dollar.But unofficially you can get 14 to 15 bolivianos per dollar. This has led to a thriving black market, especially of exports, from which the government misses out on tax revenue.Economist Gary Rodriguez, the general manager for the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade, explains   A product that costs seven bolivianos here in Bolivia can be sold for 15 bolivianos abroad,  he says. The problem is that businesses would prefer to sell items on the  overseas  black market rather than here in Bolivia which leads to food and fuel shortages.  Restrictions on the use of credit cards is another headache for Bolivia s business community. The problem with the credit cards is that all the banks have limits that are ridiculous,  says Alessandra Guglielmi, who owns a food business called The Clean Spot. You can  only  spend around  35 a month over the internet with online purchases.  35 is nothing for a business. She is concerned about her business going under. I am worried with food prices going up I can t afford to pay my staff a decent salary,  says Ms Guglielmi.  I am worried about the people not being able to afford to buy my products because I must put the prices up. And I am worried because my margins have gone down so it s very hard right now for me to keep a business.  Many people in Bolivia are hoping that a new government will be able to turn the country s fortunes around. Two right-wing candidates are currently ahead in the polls for the presidential race.Leading is Samuel Doria Medina of National Unity Front. He was previously the main shareholder of Bolivia s largest cement manufacturer.In second place is Jorge Quiroga of Freedom and Democracy. He has been president of Bolivia before, from 2001 to 2002.If no candidate gets more than half the votes on 17 August   which no-one is expected to achieve - then there will be a second round of voting on 19 October.Bolivian political scientist and analyst Franklin Pareja is sceptical that the next administration will be able to improve most people s lives.",business,Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nn665g32o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 23:29:33 GMT",948
"How to get AI to work in 22 languages. India tackles the problem of making AI translate between its many languages and dialects Vineet Sawant has spent the last two years navigating the streets of Mumbai on a scooter as a delivery driver. Being on the road is always very stressful and especially in cities like Mumbai,  he says.But when he started out language barriers were an additional problem. His first language is Marathi and Mr Sawant speaks  very little  English.  I can understand but it s very difficult to read,  he explains.That caused problems at his new job.He said   At first, it was difficult. Everything was in English, and I can understand some of it, but I m more comfortable in Marathi. I used to ask other delivery guys to help me figure out what to do. His employer, Zepto, promises  India s Fastest Online Grocery Delivery . So having drivers struggling with delivery instructions was not ideal.To smooth this process a year ago, Zepto partnered with Reverie Language Technologies to introduce an AI translation service for its drivers. Since then its delivery drivers have been able to choose between six languages on the Zepto app. I don t have to guess anymore,  says Mr Sawant.  Earlier I would take more time to read and sometimes even made mistakes. Now if the customer writes  ring bell , I get that instruction in Marathi. So, I don t have to ask or check again. It s all clear.  Mr Sawant s difficulties are common. India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects,  says Professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya, from IIT Mumbai, one of India s leading experts in the use of AI in Indian languages. Without tech, that understands and speaks these languages, millions are excluded from the digital revolution - especially in education, governance, healthcare, and banking,  he points out.The rollout of new generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, has made the task more urgent.Vast amounts of data, like web pages, books or video transcripts are used to train an AI. In widely spoken languages like Hindi and English that is relatively easy to get, but for others it is more difficult. The main challenge to create Indian language models is the availability of data. I m talking about refined data. Coarse quality data, is available. But that data is not of very high quality, it needs filtering,  says Professor Bhattacharyya. The issue in India is for many Indian languages, especially tribal and regional dialects, this data simply doesn t exist or is not digitised.  Reverie Language Technologies is now deploying its AI-driven translation technology for a range of Indian companies. Co-founder Vivekananda Pani says that while translation technology will make communication easier, there is  potential for less common dialects to be pushed aside . The challenge will be to make sure that the amazing benefits of AI-driven language advancements don t accidentally shrink the rich variety of human language.  To help tackle the problem Professor Bhattacharyya has contributed to Bhashini, a government project to develop those high quality datasets needed to train an AI. As well as the datasets, Bhashini has built AI language models and translation services in 22 languages. Started in 2022, it s a huge undertaking, but has already made a lot of progress.Bhashini currently hosts 350 AI-based language models that have processed more than a billion tasks.More than 50 government departments work with Bhashini, as well as 25 state governments.For example Bhashini tech is used in multi-lingual chatbots for public services and to translate government schemes into local languages. Bhashini ensures India s linguistic and cultural representation by building India-specific AI models rather than relying on global platforms,  says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Digital India, Bhashini Division.He hopes that within the next two or three years rural users will have voice-enabled access to government services, financial tools and information systems in their native languages. These India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population.Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging.Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking.He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. The AI  will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,  says Professor Jadhav.And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi.  It will be very customized, it will not be something just off the shelf,  he says.",business,How to get AI to work in 22 languages,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qqzz1e4zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 23:01:09 GMT",827
"Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV?. New tech promises to dub film and TV into different languages without losing the quality of the performance. Finding international films that might appeal to the US market is an important part of the work of XYZ Films.Maxime Cottray is the chief operating officer at the Los Angeles-based independent studio.He says the US market has always been tough for foreign language films. It s been limited to coastal New York viewers through art house films,  he says.It s partly a language problem. America is not a culture which has grown up with subtitles or dubbing like Europe has,  he points out.But that language hurdle might be easier to clear with a new AI-driven dubbing system. The audio and video of a recent film, Watch the Skies, a Swedish sci-fi film, was fed into a digital tool called DeepEditor.It manipulates the video to make it look like actors are genuinely speaking the language the film is made into. The first time I saw the results of the tech two years ago I thought it was good, but having seen the latest cut, it s amazing. I m convinced that if the average person if saw it, they wouldn t notice it - they d assume they were speaking whatever language that is,  says Mr Cottray.The English version of Watch The Skies was released in 110 AMC Theatres across the US in May. To contextualise this result, if the film were not dubbed into English, the film would never have made it into US cinemas in the first place,  says Mr Cottray. US audiences were able to see a Swedish independent film that otherwise only a very niche audience would have otherwise seen.  He says that AMC plans to run more releases like this. DeepEditor was developed by Flawless, which is headquartered in Soho, London.Writer and director Scott Mann founded the company in 2020, having worked on films including Heist, The Tournament and Final Score.He felt that traditional dubbing techniques for the international versions of his films didn t quite match the emotional impact of the originals. When I worked on Heist in 2014, with a brilliant cast including Robert De Niro, and then I saw that movie translated to a different language, that s when I first realised that no wonder the movies and TV don t travel well, because the old world of dubbing really kind of changes everything about the film,  says Mr Mann, now based in Los Angeles. It s all out of sync, and it s performed differently. And from a purist filmmaking perspective, a very much lower grade product is being seen by the rest of the world.  Flawless developed its own technology for identifying and modifying faces, based on a method first presented in a research paper in 2018. DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection  such as facial features  and 3D face tracking to understand the actor s appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot,  says Mr Mann.The tech can preserve actors  original performances across languages, without reshoots or re-recordings, reducing costs and time, he says.According to him, Watch the Skies was the world s first fully visually-dubbed feature film.As well as giving an actor the appearance of speaking another language, DeepEditor can also transfer a better performance from one take into another, or swap a new line of dialogue, while keeping the original performance with its emotional content intact. Thanks to the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple, the global film dubbing market is set to increase from US 4bn   3bn  in 2024 to  7.6bn by 2033, according to a report by Business Research Insights.Mr Mann won t say how much the tech costs but says it varies per project.  I d say it works out at about a tenth of the cost of shooting it or changing it any other way. His customers include  pretty much all the really big streamers .Mr Mann believes the technology will enable films to be seen by a wider audience. There is an enormous amount of incredible kind of cinema and TV out there that is just never seen by English speaking folks, because many don t want to watch it with dubbing and subtitles,  says Mr Mann.The tech isn t here to replace actors, says Mann, who says voice actors are used rather than being replaced with synthetic voices. What we found is that if you make the tools for the actual creatives and the artists themselves, that s the right way of doing it  they get kind of the power tools to do their art and that can feed into the finished product. That s the opposite of a lot of approaches that other tech companies have taken.  However, Neta Alexander, assistant professor of film and media at Yale University, says that while the promise of wider distribution is tempting, using AI to reconfigure performances for non-native markets risks eroding the specificity and texture of language, culture, and gesture. If all foreign films are adapted to look and sound English, the audience s relationship with the foreign becomes increasingly mediated, synthetic, and sanitised,  she says. This could discourage cross-cultural literacy and disincentivise support for subtitled or original-language screenings. Meanwhile, she says, the displacement of subtitles, a key tool for language learners, immigrants, deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers and many others, raises concerns about accessibility. Closed captioning is not just a workaround  it s a method of preserving the integrity of both visual and auditory storytelling for diverse audiences,  says Prof Alexander.Replacing this with automated mimicry suggests a disturbing turn toward commodified and monolingual film culture, she says. Rather than ask how to make foreign films easier for English-speaking audiences, we might better ask how to build audiences that are willing to meet diverse cinema on its own terms.",business,Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xy6r91kwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 23:01:41 GMT",982
"China s unemployed young adults who are pretending to have jobs. With Chinese youth unemployment high, individuals are paying to go into offices and pretend to work. No-one would want to work without getting a salary, or even worse   having to pay to be there.Yet paying companies so you can pretend to work for them has become popular among young, unemployed adults in China. It has led to a growing number of such providers.The development comes amid China s sluggish economy and jobs market. Chinese youth unemployment remains stubbornly high, at more than 14 .With real jobs increasingly hard to come by, some young adults would rather pay to go into an office than be just stuck at home.Shui Zhou, 30, had a food business venture that failed in 2024. In April of this year, he started to pay 30 yuan   4.20   3.10  per day to go into a mock-up office run by a business called Pretend To Work Company, in the city of Dongguan, 114 km  71 miles  north of Hong Kong.There he joins five  colleagues  who are doing the same thing. I feel very happy,  says Mr Zhou.  It s like we re working together as a group.  Such operations are now appearing in major cities across China, including Shenzhen, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Kunming. More often they look like fully-functional offices, and are equipped with computers, internet access, meeting rooms, and tea rooms.And rather than attendees just sitting around, they can use the computers to search for jobs, or to try to launch their own start-up businesses. Sometimes the daily fee, usually between 30 and 50 yuan, includes lunch, snacks and drinks. Dr Christian Yao, a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington s School of Management in New Zealand, is an expert on the Chinese economy. The phenomenon of pretending to work is now very common,  he says.  Due to economic transformation and the mismatch between education and the job market, young people need these places to think about their next steps, or to do odd jobs as a transition. Pretend office companies are one of the transitional solutions. Mr Zhou came across the Pretend To Work Company while browsing social media site Xiaohongshu. He says he felt that the office environment would improve his self-discipline. He has now been there for more than three months.Mr Zhou sent photos of the office to his parents, and he says they feel much more at ease about his lack of employment.While attendees can arrive and leave whenever they want, Mr Zhou usually gets to the office between 8am and 9am. Sometimes he doesn t leave until 11pm, only departing after the manager of the business has left.He adds that the other people there are now like friends. He says that when someone is busy, such as job hunting, they work hard, but when they have free time they chat, joke about, and play games. And they often have dinner together after work.Mr Zhou says that he likes this team building, and that he is much happier than before he joined. In Shanghai, Xiaowen Tang rented a workstation at a pretend work company in Shanghai for a month earlier this year. The 23-year-old graduated from university last year and hasn t found a full-time job yet.Her university has an unwritten rule that students must sign an employment contract or provide proof of internship within one year of graduation  otherwise, they won t receive a diploma.She sent the office scene to the school as proof of her internship. In reality, she paid the daily fee, and sat in the office writing online novels to earn some pocket money. If you re going to fake it, just fake it to the end,  says Ms Tang. Dr Biao Xiang, director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany, says that China s pretending to work trend comes from a  sense of frustration and powerlessness  regarding a lack of job opportunities. Pretending to work is a shell that young people find for themselves, creating a slight distance from mainstream society and giving themselves a little space. The owner of the Pretend To Work Company in the city of Dongguan is 30-year-old Feiyu  a pseudonym .  What I m selling isn t a workstation, but the dignity of not being a useless person,  he says.He himself has been unemployed in the past, after a previous retail business that he owned had to close during the Covid pandemic.  I was very depressed and a bit self-destructive,  he recalls.  You wanted to turn the tide, but you were powerless. In April of this year he started to advertise Pretend To Work, and within a month all the workstations were full.

"Rayner admits underpaying tax on Hove flat as PM backs her. The deputy prime minister says she has referred herself for an ethics probe by the PM s adviser. Angela Rayner has admitted she underpaid stamp duty when buying her  800,000 flat in Hove, as the prime minister gave her his backing.The deputy prime minister and housing secretary said arrangements on her family home in Greater Manchester meant she should have paid a higher rate.She denied she had tried to dodge the extra tax, blaming the  mistake  on initial legal advice that failed to  properly take account  of the situation.Sir Keir Starmer stood by his deputy at Prime Minister s Questions, saying he was  very proud to sit alongside  her.But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called on him to sack her, calling her position  untenable . Rayner says she has now contacted HMRC to work out the tax she needs to pay, and referred herself for investigation by the PM s standards adviser. She has been under mounting pressure in recent weeks after reports she had saved  40,000 in stamp duty on the East Sussex flat by not paying the higher rate reserved for additional home purchases.Her admission of an extra tax liability is damaging for the deputy prime minister, who was prominent in attacking the conduct of Tory ministers before Labour took office last year.It also presents a political headache for Sir Keir, with Rayner - also Labour s deputy leader - providing a key link to the left of the party and the unions upon which it depends for support.The Conservatives have also sought to highlight that Labour raised the higher stamp duty rate from an extra 3  to 5  at last year s Budget. In a statement, Rayner confirmed she had paid the standard rate of stamp duty when buying the flat in May, after receiving legal advice.She added that she had part-funded the purchase by selling her remaining stake in her family home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, which she shares with her ex-husband and family.Some of her interest in the home had already been sold following her divorce to a court-instructed trust previously set up to help fund the care for her son, who has lifelong disabilities, she said.The arrangement had been designed to give him  security of knowing the home is his, allowing him to continue to live in the home he feels safe in,  she added, and was  a standard practice in circumstances like ours .But fresh legal advice revealed  complex deeming provisions  in the trust meant she should have paid the higher stamp duty rate on the purchase of the Hove flat, she said. I acknowledge that due to my reliance on advice from lawyers which did not properly take account of these provisions, I did not pay the appropriate stamp duty at the time of the purchase,  she added. I deeply regret the error that has been made. I am committed to resolving this matter fully and providing the transparency that public service demands.  Downing Street has yet to set out the terms of reference for the inquiry that will now take place by Sir Laurie Magnus, the PM s adviser on ministerial interests.At Prime Minister s Questions, Sir Keir told MPs that Rayner had  explained her personal circumstances in detail . I know from speaking at length to the deputy prime minister just how difficult that decision was for her.  She has now referred herself to the independent adviser. That is the right thing to do,  he added. But speaking to reporters, Kemi Badenoch said   If the prime minister had a backbone, then he should have sacked her already. If you are the deputy prime minister helping to set tax policy, if you are the housing secretary deciding where people are going to live  and  how much that s going to cost, then you need to get your own affairs in order,  she said. Of course we understand that people have different circumstances, and difficult personal circumstances. But that doesn t mean that you should not follow the law. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Rayner s position  may well become untenable  if the investigation concludes she has broken ministerial rules.But he added   As a parent of a disabled child, I know the thing my wife and I worry most about is our son s care after we have gone. So I can completely understand and trust that the deputy prime minister was thinking about the same thing here.  The existence of the trust had not previously been known, and Rayner said she had been prevented from sharing more details due to a court order that was lifted on Tuesday after she successfully applied to have it waived.Asked whether she had thought about resigning instead of disclosing details about her son, she told Sky News   I spoke to my family about it.  I spoke to my ex-husband, who has been an incredibly supportive person because he knows that all I ve done is try and support my family and help them. The number one priority for me and my ex-husband has always been to support our children and do the best thing for our children. Rayner has not said at what point she took the further additional legal advice that revealed her additional tax liability.As recently as Friday, the deputy prime minister had insisted she had paid the  relevant duty  on the Hove property.Sir Keir publicly backed his deputy on Monday, adding she had  had people briefing against her and talking her down over and over again .No 10 has not said when the PM was informed about Rayner s underpayment or whether he had seen the legal advice.The Tories have also questioned whether Rayner s grace-and-favour flat in Admiralty House in central London should be her main home for council tax purposes, instead of her Ashton-under-Lyne home. The Cabinet Office has previously said it was a  longstanding principle  that the government covers council tax on official residences where they are used by ministers as a second home.In her statement, Rayner said the house in Ashton-under-Lyne remained her  family home , where she is registered for most official and financial purposes, including credit cards, and kept the  majority of my possessions .",politics,Rayner admits underpaying tax on Hove flat as PM backs her,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50446rq73o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:49:40 GMT",1041
"Rayner at risk of fine over stamp duty, tax experts say. The deputy PM has admitted underpaying stamp duty on her  800,000 flat in Hove, East Sussex. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is at risk of a fine from the tax authorities in addition to having to pay an additional  40,000 in underpaid stamp duty, tax experts have said.Rayner, who is also the minister in charge of housing, has admitted she paid less in stamp duty on her  800,000 flat in Hove, East Sussex, than she should have done, claiming she was badly advised. HM Revenue and Customs  HMRC  can levy penalties when tax has been underpaid if someone has been  careless  with their tax affairs.Any penalty for Rayner, which is typically 20  or 30  of the underpaid tax, could hinge on whether she took appropriate legal advice.Rayner has said she was misinformed by lawyers, but questions have been raised about whether she sought specialist tax advice.Even if she did, she could still face a fine likely to be 30  of the underpaid tax, meaning an additional  12,000. Someone has made a big mistake. Whether it s the law firm acting for her on the purchase, or whether it is her,  said Sean Randall, an independent stamp duty expert.He said she was at  significant risk  of a penalty because blaming an adviser may not be a sufficient defence. She might say I relied on my tax advisers to advise me correctly. And I definitely sympathise with that  but  usually simply relying on your adviser is not a defence for a penalty of carelessness,  Randall added. The dispute centres around a three-bedroom flat in Hove, East Sussex which Angela Rayner bought for  800,000 in May this year.When she bought the flat, she declared that it was the only property she owned, meaning  30,000 of stamp duty was paid, rather than the  70,000 due if it is a second home.She claimed it was the only home she owned because she had previously given up her stake in the family home in her constituency in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.Rayner had bought that property with her then-husband, Mark Rayner, in 2016.As she outlined in a statement, in 2020 a trust was set up under the instructions of a court to manage a payout for a medical incident which had left their son with life-long disabilities.In 2023, when her divorce from Mark was finalised, the pair elected to place part of their stakes in the home into their son s trust, for which they are among the trustees. This was to enable a  nesting  arrangement, meaning the children could remain in the family home while the parents alternated living there.Rayner sold her remaining 25  stake in the home to her son s trust in January this year, for which she received  162,500.The trust had been set up by Shoosmiths, a major law firm which offers advice on many areas of law including tax and property.But when she purchased the flat in Hove , she sought legal advice from a different, unidentified firm.In a statement, a spokesperson for Shoosmiths told BBC News that they  did not act for the Rt Hon Angela Rayner in relation to the purchase of her Hove property and or the  stamp duty  aspects of that property. Ms Rayner is not a current client of the firm and has not been for some time. Rayner s team have not provided details of the law firm she used instead, and it is not clear if this was a conveyancing lawyer who specialises in property transactions or more specialist tax advice.Rayner said that when she bought the Hove flat,  my understanding, on advice from lawyers, was that my circumstances meant I was liable for the standard rate of stamp duty .This was because she had no financial stake in the Ashton home, even though her children remained there and she considered it her main residence. She also spends time at a government-provided flat in Admiralty Arch, central London.However, this legal advice was wrong. This is because under tax law, if a property has been placed into trust for the benefit of children under 18, the parents of those children are deemed to be owners of the home for stamp duty purposes. If you have a trust in favour of your children, then it s treated as your property,  said Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates and a member of the Labour Party. We re talking about a deeming rule which deems a person, in this case Angela, to own a property in the stamp duty world in circumstances  where  she doesn t own it at all in the real world,  Randall added. The question of what legal advice Rayner took when she bought the Hove property is crucial. If it was simply a conveyancing lawyer with no tax expertise it is likely to be much harder for her to argue that she hasn t been negligent - and to avoid harsh penalties levied by the taxman. My suspicion in this case is that she didn t give all the circumstances of the trust to the conveyancing lawyer,  said James Quarmby, head of private wealth at Stephenson Harwood. The conveyancing lawyer may have just asked the bland question  do you own any other properties?  And she says  no  .He said property lawyers typically state in their contracts that they don t provide tax advice.Quarmby said he believed there was a  high  risk of Rayner being fined and that tax officials would want to see the advice she relied on and details of the instructions she had given her lawyer Relying on advice is not a complete defence - it must be reasonable to do so in the circumstances and that advice cannot be  obviously wrong ,  he said. Someone in the Revenue now with the whole glare of the UK s media on them is going to make a decision as to whether Rayner was careless,  he said.  If she gets a penalty for carelessness she is politically screwed .Another key question - if the legal advice sought was from a conveyancer - is whether Rayner even mentioned her son s trust and the role it played in the ownership of her family home.A spokesman for Rayner declined to answer these questions. If you re buying property and you have complicated affairs involving a trust, you need to speak to a tax adviser and tell them about the trust,  Neidle said. If she did that and they got it wrong,  it is  not her fault. But if she didn t go to a specialist or didn t tell them about the trust, I think it was her fault,  he added. I think a normal person with any sophistication would realise they should mention the trust when getting advice about something else. And a deputy prime minister who s already got into a previous tax scrape involving properties, surely should have a go. He said this would also affect how HMRC levied penalties on the underpaid tax.Rayner now faces an inquiry by the standards watchdog. She has previously been critical of tax avoidance and also called former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi s position  untenable  when details emerged that he was in dispute with HMRC over his tax affairs.Zahawi, who was forced to resign as Tory party chairman for failing to declare that he paid a settlement to HMRC, ended up paying  5m to settle the dispute - a sum which included a 30 per cent penalty for being  careless .A similar verdict on Rayner s conduct from Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent ethics adviser, or from the tax authorities may prove politically fatal.",politics,"Rayner at risk of fine over stamp duty, tax experts say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62n366q306o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:46:33 GMT",1277
"Analysis  Rayner s political future under threat after tax admission. The deputy prime minister has referred herself for an ethics probe by the PM s adviser. The housing secretary has admitted paying the wrong amount of tax on a house.That is pretty much the worst headline conceivable about any housing secretary, let alone Angela Rayner, who is also the deputy prime minister and spent years as Labour s sleazehunter-in-chief.That s the straightforward fact which makes this such a damaging, indeed career-threatening, episode for Rayner.Other elements are not quite so straightforward. The case was untypical because it involved her divorce, and a trust Rayner and her ex-husband had set up to provide for her son, who has lifelong disabilities. Crucially, Rayner is adamant that she sought advice from a lawyer about the stamp duty liable, and has only now learnt from a different lawyer that that advice was wrong. It is on that basis that she is not resigning.It is no doubt on that basis as well that Sir Keir Starmer full-throatedly defended his deputy at Prime Minister s Questions this afternoon - though remember that while he could sack her from her government positions she has an independent mandate as deputy leader of the Labour Party which only she can give up.It is also on the basis of the flawed initial advice that Labour officials, ministers and MPs mostly seem as of this afternoon to believe that Rayner will probably survive the independent investigation into whether she has breached the ministerial code.Whether she will survive in the court of public opinion is being treated as a separate matter altogether. There are few attacks more devastating in politics than the charge that there is one rule for them and another for the rest of us. That s why Labour politicians, including Rayner, deployed it so often in opposition themselves.Within the Labour Party, Rayner is - as one senior figure put it this afternoon -  Teflon . Having backed Sir Keir s more left wing leadership opponent back in 2020, she and the PM have had at times a difficult, and occasionally extremely difficult, relationship.But she has made herself absolutely vital to his political project. As housing secretary she is responsible for delivering on one of his most important policy pledges, and as deputy prime minister she has been used to reach parts of the party the PM cannot, for example when she was tasked with helping to defuse the welfare rebellion earlier this year.Sir Keir will be desperate not to lose her from government, and she is clearly desperate not to go. But that is no longer entirely in their hands. This is certainly not how  phase two  was meant to begin.",politics,Analysis: Rayner's political future under threat after tax admission,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lx1999ez8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:11:58 GMT",451
"Reeves rejects claims of  50bn  black hole  in finances. The chancellor hit back at the idea that the government faces so large a gap between spending and tax income. Rachel Reeves has rejected forecasts of a  50bn  black hole  in the public finances, despite higher borrowing costs and expected tax rises piling pressure on the chancellor ahead of the autumn Budget.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Reeves hit back at reports speculating over her plans, arguing that  a lot of them are talking rubbish .It comes after the cost of long-term government borrowing rose to a 27-year high on Tuesday, fuelling concerns the chancellor will have to hike taxes or cut spending.Reeves said she would aim to  get the balance right  at the Budget, which will be on 26 November, but the Conservatives said the government  don t know what they re doing . Reeves told the BBC   Working people and businesses can rest assured, I know how important it is to return growth in investments to our economy and I will do that in the Budget this year. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride accused the government of not having a plan and of  stalling  the Budget  in the vain hope things might get better .Faisal Islam  Reeves will need her hard hat for the next three months Last month, an independent think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research  Niesr , estimated that the chancellor would need to plug a  50bn gap in the public finances.But the chancellor played down the figure and told the BBC Niesr had  more than most got their numbers wrong in the last few years .Forecasts for how much money Reeves needs to find to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules vary widely, with some estimates putting the figure at around  25bn.Reeves has two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These are day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Ahead of the election, Labour pledged not to increase taxes on  working people , which included VAT, National Insurance  NI  and income tax.However, at the Budget last year, she increased the amount of NI employers have to pay, which led to a backlash from many businesses and sectors, such as hospitality.U-turns on proposed welfare cuts and winter fuel payments have also put pressure on the chancellor to find alternative revenue streams.It has led to speculation the chancellor is considering tax rises on property, banks and people, but Reeves hit back at such reports. People who seem to know what is in the Budget before we have made those decisions are just wrong,  she told the BBC. A lot of them are talking rubbish, and frankly, a lot of what they re saying is irresponsible. It s up to me to decide what is in the Budget, and I will do that in a careful way, getting the balance right between making sure that we ve got enough money to fund our public services, particularly our National Health Service , whilst also ensuring that we can bring growth and investment to Britain,  she added.Reflecting on this week s changes of personnel in Downing Street, and the beefing up of the prime minister s economic team, she said she was working  in lockstep  with Number 10.The chancellor also denied that recent sharp increases in government borrowing costs hurt her credibility, saying they have  moved in line with other countries . There are global pressures on borrowing costs. You can see that around the world, from the United States to Europe and beyond. We re not immune to those,  she said. In recent days long-term borrowing costs across the world have increased, amid concerns about political uncertainty, levels of debt, and a structural shift in pension funds away from such bonds.Some commentators have argued that the UK s financial position is so weak that it will need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, but Reeves said  serious economists  don t accept that idea.She argued there were  lots of positive signs  in the economy, but accepted that more needed to be done so that  working people wherever they live, actually feel the benefits of that growth .Asked about whether she would return to the bill for welfare to make the Budget numbers add up, she said   The welfare state should always be there for people who really need it, but we also need to do more to ensure that everyone who can work does work. After the recent U-turn on welfare cuts, the terms of reference for Work and Pensions Minister Stephen Timms  review of disability benefits is expected shortly. Some Labour MPs are also campaigning for extra spending to alleviate child poverty by reversing the two-child benefit cap.The chancellor was speaking to the BBC ahead of the announcement of the Budget date.",politics,Reeves rejects claims of £50bn 'black hole' in finances,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27nm2mn5po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:00:44 GMT",827
"Jenrick criticised by judge for X post during murder trial. The High Court judge described the shadow justice secretary s message as  ill thought through . A High Court judge who oversaw one of the most serious murder trials in recent years in north-west England criticised shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick for a social media post that could have potentially influenced a jury s decision.Mr Justice Goose is reported to have described Jenrick s post as  ill thought through  and urged him to  exercise caution  amid fears, aired in court, about its potential impact on the trial of a gangland killer.Elias Morgan, a career armed robber, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years on Tuesday for shooting dead father-of-three Lenny Scott.The former prison officer had refused years earlier to be corrupted by Morgan. Jenrick, who has not commented, shadows the Lord Chancellor Shabana Mahmood, the cabinet minister who oversees the independence of the courts.Speaking to Parliament s Constitution Committee on Wednesday morning, she said no parliamentarian should be  risking a contempt and the possibility of a murderer walking free . There was no finding by the court that Jenrick was in contempt. On 2 July prosecution and defence lawyers in the Elias Morgan case appeared at Preston Crown Court to raise with Mr Justice Goose a post from Jenrick that they feared could have influenced jurors.The Liverpool Echo had a reporter in court who first published the exchanges. The BBC has independently corroborated the account with a number of sources.The court heard that Jenrick, a solicitor by background, had posted the following on X   Lenny exposed corruption and took on the gangster controlling a prison wing. He received threats to his life, but he was left unsupported. Four years later he was shot dead. That will enrage any decent person. We need radical change, now.  The Echo reported that Caroline Goodwin KC, defence counsel for Morgan, told the judge that the post was in her analysis  appalling, outrageous and egregious  and that Jenrick  should know better . We ask he reflects carefully as a shadow lord chancellor should. We ask he thinks and he refrains from commenting further. Prosecutor Alex Leach KC told the judge the post was  problematic  because it presented as fact matters of evidence which were for the jury to deliberate on.Mr Justice Goose said Jenrick s post had been  ill thought through given it s an ongoing trial . I ask anyone who reports on this trial on social media to exercise caution and care before they post what they want to say. I hope the author of this message hears what I say and the reason for it. The BBC understands that prosecution officials then took steps to ensure Jenrick was informed of the concerns and the post was later removed. In English law, posts on social media can be deemed capable of prejudicing a jury - and therefore influencing the outcome of a trial.There are very few instances of trials having ever been completely derailed by allegedly prejudicial public comment - and judges direct to juries to ignore media reports or comment outside of court.However, the risk of jury prejudice is taken exceptionally seriously by judges and can in extreme situations lead to prosecutions.There were no submissions in court that any jurors had actually seen the post or that they had been influenced and the judge indicated that the post s deletion would be the end of the matter. On Wednesday, Mahmood told the constitution committee politicians of all stripes had to play a role in protecting public trust in the law. No parliamentarian should be risking a contempt and the possibility of a murderer walking free,  she said. There are just some very important rules that all politicians with their huge platforms should bear in mind. It will be an absolute travesty of justice if somebody walks free from a murder charge because of social media activities and the desire to have a viral tweet. That is, and always will be, unacceptable.",politics,Jenrick criticised by judge for X post during murder trial,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjmd51807o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:27:09 GMT",673
"Online speech laws need to be reviewed after Linehan arrest, says Streeting. The health secretary says ministers wanted police to focus on street crime rather than posts on social media. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said ministers need to  look at  laws concerning online speech, following the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan.The health secretary said such laws had put  more expectation on police  and  diluted the focus and priorities of the public , adding  that s obviously something we need to look at .Streeting told the BBC it was  very easy for people to criticise police  who were only enforcing laws that had been passed by MPs, saying ministers wanted officers to focus on street crime rather than posts on social media.His comments come after the Father Ted co-creator was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence in posts on the X website. The arrest prompted a backlash from figures such as author JK Rowling and opposition parties including the Conservatives, who branded the arrest an  absurd infringement of free speech .In a statement, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said  officers involved in the arrest had reasonable grounds to believe an offence had been committed  under a law called the Public Order Act.Sir Mark said  reasonable people would agree that genuine threats of physical violence against an identified person or group should be acted upon by officers .But the police chief said in  lesser cases...policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments .He said   I don t believe we should be policing toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible position.  I have offered to provide suggestions to the Home Office on where the law and policy should be clarified.  Greater clarity and common sense would enable us to limit the resources we dedicate to tackling online statements to those cases creating real threats in the real world. When asked about Linehan s arrest at Prime Minister s Questions, Sir Keir Starmer said  we must ensure police focus on the most serious issues . That includes tackling issues like anti-social behaviour, knife crime and violence,  he prime minister said.  We have a long history of free speech in this country. I m very proud of that and I will always defend it. When asked about the Linehan case on the BBC s Today programme, Streeting echoed those words. As the prime minister and home secretary have been clear, we want the police to focus on policing streets rather than tweets,  the health secretary said. But the thing we are mindful of, as a government that backs the police to keep us safe, is that police are there to enforce the laws that we as Parliament legislate for. So if over the years, with good intentions, Parliament has layered more and more expectation on police, and diluted the focus and priorities of the public, that s obviously something we need to look at.  Pressed on whether the law should be changed, Streeting said   When it comes to speech, context is king. We do have to, as legislators, tread really carefully when it comes to boundaries of free speech. Streeting said it was  hard for the police sometimes, because they have to apply the law as written, not the law as it was intended .He also said  we are all - let s be honest - quite anxious  about some of the arrests and prosecutions over comments online.Streeting added   And you think, is that really what Parliament intended when we wrote these laws? So we ve got to get the law right. Police are there to enforce the law that parliament makes. Mr Linehan, 57, said he had been detained by five armed officers at Heathrow Airport after flying in from the US.He said in an online Substack article that officials then became concerned for his health and took him to hospital.The Metropolitan Police said that a man in his 50s had been arrested on 1 September at Heathrow Airport and taken to hospital.The police said his condition was not life-threatening and he was bailed pending further investigation.In his Substack article, Mr Linehan said his arrest was related to three posts on X from April.The first post, from his X feed, said   If a trans-identified male is in a female-only space, he is committing a violent, abusive act. Make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails, punch him in the balls. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch was critical of the arrest, saying   Sending five officers to arrest a man for a tweet isn t policing, it s politics. Under Labour, we routinely see burglary, knife crime and assaults go unsolved, while resources are wasted on thought-policing. But new Green Party leader Zack Polanski told BBC Newsnight the posts were  totally unacceptable  and the arrest seemed  proportionate .Sir Max Hill, the former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, said police use various laws, such as the Public Order Act, to prosecute people accused of breaking the law through their speech.Sir Max said people can be prosecuted for inciting violence. If you don t have that mechanism, then I m afraid chaos ensues,  he said.  It is possible to cross over into criminality by words alone. Shami Chakrabarti, a Labour peer and former director of Liberty, a civil liberties group, said  the public order statute book and speech offences in particular do need an overarching review .She said some offences related to alarm and distress were  too broad . But inciting violence must always be a criminal offence,  Baroness Chakrabarti added.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is expected to raise the Linehan case and rail against  censorship  in the UK, when he gives evidence to the House Judiciary Committee in the US on free speech on Wednesday.Senior American politicians, including US Vice President JD Vance, have raised concerns about freedom of speech in the UK and prosecutions over comments posted online.Since coming to office this year, the US vice president has repeatedly criticised measures like the UK s Online Safety Act and claimed free speech in Europe was  in retreat .The case of Lucy Connolly, who was jailed for stirring up racial hatred against asylum seekers following the Southport attack last year, has been highlighted by some politicians in the debate about free speech in the UK.Separately, Mr Linehan is also facing a separate charge of harassment - which he denies - and is due to appear in court on Thursday.",politics,"Online speech laws need to be reviewed after Linehan arrest, says Streeting",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2922w73e1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:20:49 GMT",1083
"Ministers favour merging all UK steel companies into one. The government believes the struggling sector s six companies should be merged together, sources tell the BBC. The government is in favour of merging all the UK s steelmakers, but ministers do not want to nationalise any of the companies, the BBC can reveal.There are six steel companies in the UK, four of which are currently being financially supported by the government, and ministers believe the sector is too fragmented.It is understood the preference inside the Department for Business and Trade  DBT  is to find a joint buyer, rather than nationalise the companies.Any future plan would need the backing of the current owners, but it is understood ministers have told the sector they believe a merger is the best way to be sustainable in the long-term. The UK s steel industry has faced major financial difficulties in recent years due to high energy prices, increased tariffs and a glut of steel in the global market.Ministers are already searching for buyers for two steel companies and another has been publicly owned since 2021.The UK wing of Liberty Steel in South Yorkshire collapsed into government control last month after insolvency courts granted a compulsory winding up order.Speciality Steels UK  SSUK , part of the Liberty Steel metals empire of controversial tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, was placed in the hands of a government appointed liquidator last month and ministers have agreed to cover the ongoing wages and costs of the plant while a buyer is sought.It s understood that a number of commercial buyers have already approached the government about taking over SSUK, which has already transitioned to greener electric arc furnaces.Ministers took control of British Steel in Scunthorpe in April after accusing the Chinese owners Jingye of trying to close down the site s blast furnaces.The search for a new buyer for British Steel has stalled in recent months after Jingye unexpectedly asked for a sum in the hundreds of millions to hand over ownership.BBC News has been told that Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is set to fly to China next week to negotiate with Jingye officials.There is some concern within government that finding a buyer for British Steel may be more difficult, given the site uses old-fashioned blast furnaces.Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, was given a  500m government rescue package last year to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.Sheffield Forgemasters was nationalised by the Ministry of Defence in 2021 after the company faced financial difficulties throughout the 2010s.A senior source in the Department for Business and Trade said   We are trying to fix the UK steel sector in the round.  We needed Jingye off the board, we are very close to doing that. We needed Gupta off the board, we ve done that.

The Budget will take place on Wednesday 26 November, the chancellor has announced.Rachel Reeves confirmed the date when she will outline the government s tax and spending plans to pay for things such as hospitals, schools, the military and the police.It comes as the chancellor faces mounting pressure to balance the public finances, while trying to boost economic growth and maintain the confidence of investors on financial markets.Economists have warned tax rises or spending cuts must be made if Reeves is to meet her borrowing rules, given growth has been sluggish and inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has been increasing. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Reeves said   Do I accept that we need to do more to turn the economy around so that working people have the tools and the training and the opportunities to fulfil their potential? Absolutely we do. She said her second Budget would be focused on ensuring that  we are investing in our economy and ensuring that working people wherever they live in our country are better off .Labour pledged in its election manifesto to not increase taxes on  working people , which included VAT, National Insurance  NI  and income tax.At the Budget last year, the chancellor increased the amount of NI employers have to pay, which led to a backlash from many businesses and sectors, such as hospitality. Given the government s pledges, speculation has grown over what taxes Reeves could increase, which suggestions ranging from a windfall tax on the profits of banks to various property taxes or reforming the council tax system.And with long-term borrowing costs reaching their highest level since 1998, it is getting increasingly expensive to service government debt, eating up what little financial buffer - about  10bn - the chancellor has.Speaking in Prime Minister s Questions on Wednesday afternoon, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said higher borrowing costs were a result of Labour s  bad choices. She accused Sir Keir Starmer of  dragging down the country , adding that  markets can see that he is too weak to control spending .But the prime minister said Labour had spent their first year in government putting out the fires created by the Tories who were  the arsonist  for  blowing up the finances .Reeves confirmed she has instructed the government s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR  to begin the 10-week process of producing a new economic forecast based on her policies for the end of November.The OBR s assessment of the government s plans is seen as a key factor in ensuring financial markets remain stable and investors, who typically loan the UK money, maintain confidence in the UK economy.The reports of various policy plans have led to uncertainty in recent weeks and some economists had suggested the government should end uncertainty over possible changes with a fast turnaround Budget in October. Instead the government will take two and a half months to decide the detail of what is expected to be a tax-raising and reforming statement. Reeves highlighted that the government had increased the minimum wage, cut NHS waiting times and had begun reforming the planning system it hopes will lead to 1.5 million homes being built in England. And we must bring inflation and borrowing costs down by keeping a tight grip on day to day spending through our non-negotiable fiscal rules. It s only by doing this can we afford to do the things we want to do. If renewal is our mission and growth is our challenge, investment and reform are our tools. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour were  stalling, leaving the Budget until as late as possible in the vain hope things might get better . This dither and delay only prolongs the doom and uncertainty unnecessarily,  he said.  Labour don t have a plan - and they don t know what they re doing .Lord Jim O Neill, former Goldman Sachs chief economist who has advised both Labour and the Conservatives said it was  decision time  for the PM and the chancellor.He said many  rational analysts  were suggesting three or four  big things that have to be tackled , if the UK wanted to solve its financial challenges. These included, he said, the pension triple lock, the housing market, welfare reform and NHS productivity. I think they re quite focused on the latter. But the other three, we just don t really know,  he told the BBC. The markets are now at the point where something needs to happen on that big stuff because you can t keep going along tampering along at the margin.  Treasury sources said the end of November was in line with typical timing for an Autumn budgetary statement, and that it left time for the  full process  involving the OBR.The first stage is for the OBR to deliver a new baseline forecast for the UK later this month, which will incorporate a critical new assessment of long-term productivity. This move alone could open up a difficult hole in the public finances, on top of existing announced U-turns on welfare cuts, and the impact of higher government borrowing costs. The OBR will tell the Treasury how much taxes will have to rise by or spending will have to be cut by in order to meet the chancellor s borrowing rules.The government will then outline likely measures to the forecasters who will assess how much they are forecast to raise or to cost the exchequer.Reeves has two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These are day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Last month, the independent National Institute for Economics and Social Research think tank said that the overall gap in the public finances could reach as much as  50bn a year. It pointed to the need to re-establish what it calls  a large buffer  for Reeves to avoid missing her self-imposed borrowing rules.In recent days long-term borrowing costs across the world have increased, amid concerns about political uncertainty, levels of debt, and a structural shift in pension funds away from such bonds.However, Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England s governor told MPs on Wednesday it was  important not to put too much emphasis on the cost of 30-year borrowing because such long-dated bonds are not currently being used to raise funds  for the government.",politics,"Budget to be held on 26 November, Reeves confirms",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7545yz0171o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:09:55 GMT",1104
"Asylum protests putting police under chronic pressure, chief says. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens says police were notified about over 3,000 summer protests and warns against an  increase in tension and polarity . Protests over the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers have put police forces under  chronic pressure  when combined with other duties this summer, a senior police chief has said.Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs  Council, told the BBC people in leadership positions in the UK needed to think about how to  reduce and diffuse tension and not sow division .Senior officers are concerned about political and business leaders commenting on social media, sometimes spreading misinformation, though Mr Stephens didn t give names.Police were notified about 3,081 protests between the start of June and 25 August, compared with 2,942 last summer and 928 in 2023. The number has been pushed up by campaigns against asylum hotels, sometimes attended by hundreds of protesters on both sides of the debate.For every protest police have at least to assess what level of resources to commit, whether it goes ahead or not.Mr Stephens said it was everybody s responsibility, including the police, to  set the tone , but he continued to defend the right to protest. We all want to live in places where we can be safe, and where we feel safe,  he said.Police forces all over the country have been responding to protests this summer, pulling in officers from neighbourhood roles to do public order duties. Through the system of mutual aid, police forces with fewer protests have have sent reinforcements across the country to back up those under pressure.In Epping, where protests began outside the Bell Hotel in July, hundreds of police officers have been involved, often keeping pro and anti-migrant groups separated and preventing activists getting into the hotel.At least 30 more protests are planned this weekend.On Tuesday, the Conservative leader of Epping Forest District Council said he would be asking campaigners demanding the closure of the Bell Hotel to halt their protests.Councillor Chris Whitbread said in a statement   I am approaching the other group leaders on Epping Forest District Council and other community leaders to jointly ask protesters to reflect on whether they continue with the twice-weekly local protests. If you choose to continue, it should be done considerately and calmly, with awareness of the impact on local residents and the local economy. The people of Epping are under great strain. As schools return this week, I appeal to the protest organisers to show restraint and give our families and children some much needed respite. Mr Stephens said the demand on policing could be reduced by better integration of refugees. Where there s a lack of integration, whether that s through accommodation or placement in local communities, to a certain extent, the model doesn t matter. It s the effort that we go to work together as a community that reduces the demand on policing,  he said.Police chiefs are waiting for the government to publish plans to reform the service so it can cope better with modern challenges. They re hoping for a radical long-term strategy.Last year, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper argued that the co-ordinated national response to the disorder in summer 2024 in the wake of the Southport attack had demonstrated the need for more centralisation.She announced a National Centre of Policing to bring together support services for local forces, including national IT systems, shared police helicopters and a centralised forensics service.The Home Office has been approached for comment by the BBC.",politics,"Asylum protests putting police under chronic pressure, chief says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6272r550w3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:31:49 GMT",590
"Government unable to calculate Afghan data breach cost, watchdog says. The National Audit Office says it has not been given enough information to have  confidence  a relocation scheme cost  850m. The government is unable to calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan it set up following the Afghan data leak, the public spending watchdog has said.The Ministry of Defence  MoD  estimates the cost of the massive data breach - and setting up a new scheme to relocate those whose lives might be at risk over it - to be  850m. But the National Audit Office  NAO  says the MoD has not provided enough evidence to give it confidence in that figure, which does not include legal expenses, or compensation claims likely to follow. The MoD said it was committed to transparency and  committed to honouring the moral obligation we owe to those Afghans who stood with us and risked their lives . Last month it was revealed the details of almost 19,000 people had applied to move to the UK in order to flee the Taliban were leaked, when an official mistakenly emailed a spreadsheet that contained a hidden tab with the information in 2022.It contained information like names, contact details and family information of people who believed their cooperation with British forces during the Afghanistan war put them at risk of reprisals. The names of British officials including members of UK special forces were also included in the data breach.More than 16,000 Afghans and family members were eligible to resettle under an existing relocation scheme. Following the data breach, a new scheme - the Afghanistan Response Route  ARR  - was secretly set up in April 2024, allowing a further 7,000 to come to the UK. A super-injunction granted by the High Court in September 2023 prevented the incident being reported for almost two years, before the order was lifted in July.The MoD estimates the cost for resettling each individual to be  128,000, with the total bill for all its Afghan resettlement programmes forecast to exceed  2bn. In a report, the NAO said the government had failed to provide sufficient evidence to give the watchdog  confidence  to say if its  850m figure was accurate.The watchdog said   The MoD is not able to determine exactly what it has spent on resettling people through the ARR scheme. This is because it did not separately identify the costs of the ARR scheme in its accounting system, meaning that these costs were not visible in its management accounts, but instead included them within its total spending on Afghan resettlement activities. A spokesperson for the MoD said   We are committed to honouring the moral obligation we owe to those Afghans who stood with us and risked their lives. Since taking the decision to support the lifting of the super injunction brought by the previous government, we have been clear on the costs associated with relocating eligible Afghans to the UK - and are fully committed to transparency. The cost of all Afghan resettlement schemes, including the Afghan Response Route, has been fully funded as part of the Government s Spending Review.",politics,"Government unable to calculate Afghan data breach cost, watchdog says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k25dx1z3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:56:06 GMT",518

"UK borrowing costs hit 27-year high adding to pressure on Reeves. The interest rate on UK 30-year bonds hits the highest since 1998 as concerns over the economic outlook continue. UK government long-term borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1998, adding to the pressure on the chancellor ahead of the Budget.The interest rate on 30-year government bonds, known as the yield, jumped to 5.72 , making it more expensive for the government to borrow money.There are rising expectations that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will increase taxes in the Budget later this year in order to meet her borrowing and spending rules, as worries grow about the state of the government s finances.On the currency markets, the pound also fell more than 1  against the dollar on Tuesday. Sterling fell against the dollar to  1.3388, which is the lowest level against the US currency since 7 August.The UK was not alone in seeing borrowing costs rise, with yields on 30-year German, French and Dutch bonds climbing to their highest since 2011.In the US, 30-year Treasury bond yields rose to their highest in more than a month.A number of factors have led to borrowing costs for governments around the globe to go up, such as geopolitical tensions, US President Donald Trump s trade policies and the upcoming confidence vote in the French government.Meanwhile, there was appetite for shorter-term UK government debt. The UK Debt Management Office sold a record  14bn of 10-year bonds on Tuesday after attracting  141bn worth of orders by investors. But Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the chancellor faced  highly difficult choices  in the Budget. In its manifesto, Labour promised not to raise taxes such as income tax, VAT or national insurance on  working people . This has led to much speculation over what taxes Reeves could raise in the autumn Budget. One option suggested is that the freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028, could be extended. Often referred to as a  stealth tax , freezing income tax thresholds means that, over time as salaries rise, more people are dragged into paying higher rates.There have also been reports that Reeves is considering reforming property taxes. With so many options for raising taxes being bandied about during the summer, there appears to be concern that the decisions made might not be sufficiently thought through,  said Ms Streeter. The worry isn t just that government coffers won t be replenished, but that they will be filled at the expense of growth, leading to a vicious circle emerging. On Monday, the government announced a partial reshuffle, with Darren Jones, formerly Reeves s deputy, being given a key No 10 role by the prime minister.The changes are focused on beefing up the economic know-how in Downing Street. Baroness Shafik, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been named at Keir Starmer s new chief economic adviser.The moves are a recognition that the upcoming autumn s Budget will be a defining moment in this Labour government. Governments borrow money from investors by selling bonds - which is a loan the government promises to pay back at the end of an agreed time.The yield on 30-year UK government bonds - known as gilts - has been rising for some months, and this makes it more expensive for the government to borrow money due to higher interest payments.The government s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR , takes borrowing costs into account when looking at whether the chancellor is meeting her self-imposed fiscal rules.When she became chancellor, Reeves set out two rules on government borrowing, which she has repeatedly said are  non-negotiable . These were day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30Part of the reason Reeves is under pressure is that her financial buffer to stick to these rules is a relatively slim  10bn. The chancellor recently refused to rule out tax rises after disappointing data on economic growth.On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Starmer said the government s  iron-clad commitment to our robust fiscal rules remains , adding it had made the necessary decisions to  stabilise the public finances .But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest market movements were  another economic disaster from Rachel Reeves - and a clear vote of no confidence in Labour from the markets . With more tax rises on the horizon, the economy is now in a precarious position,  he added.There has been a wide range of forecasts for how much money Reeves might need to raise in the Budget to meet her rules.One factor that will influence this is the borrowing costs facing the government.When the OBR makes makes its forecasts for government debt it looks at yields on all bonds.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said concerns about the path of UK inflation and interest rates, combined with global issues, were pushing UK government borrowing costs up.In addition, he added that pension funds were also not buying as much long-term government debt due to the change in recent years from defined-benefit to defined-contribution schemes.Mr Dales said Reeves would have to raise between  18bn and  28bn in the Budget to avoid breaking her fiscal rules, and to maintain her  10bn buffer.Households and banks  will probably feel the brunt of the higher taxes , he said.",politics,UK borrowing costs hit 27-year high adding to pressure on Reeves,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy989njnq2wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 16:46:17 GMT",911
"Sue Gray questions class-based civil service internship scheme. The PM s former chief of staff says she  learned a lot from being around people from different walks of life  in the civil service. Sir Keir Starmer s former chief of staff Baroness Sue Gray has challenged the government s plan to limit a civil service internship scheme to working-class students.The Labour peer questioned the  evidence base  behind last month s decision to restrict a Whitehall internship to students from  lower socio-economic backgrounds .The government argued the change will bring in  more working-class young people  widening the talent pool for a civil service that will  truly reflect the country .But Baroness Gray told peers she was  from the most working class of backgrounds  but had  learned a lot from being around people from different walks of life . From October 2026, Whitehall s main internship scheme designed to attract university students to the civil service will now only be available for students from  lower socio-economic backgrounds  - judged by what jobs their parents did when they were 14.Those who are successful on the internship will then be prioritised for entry to the Fast Stream, the main graduate programme for entry to the civil service.But Baroness Gray said   As a former civil servant from the most working class of backgrounds, and I m sure there are very good intentions here, I would have found it really difficult when I joined the civil service to not have a wider group that I actually was exposed to, and I learned so much from that. I would like to know what the evidence base is for actually reaching this conclusion, because I do think it s good intentioned, but I think there are other ways that the civil service can be opened up as well. Labour minister Baroness Anderson of Stoke-on-Trent said this was one of the  rare  occasions she  disagreed  with Baroness Gray. This is not about stopping the civil service being a meritocracy. It is ensuring that the meritocracy is available to everyone, regardless of where you were born,  she saidEarlier, Tory shadow Cabinet Office minister Baroness Finn pointed out that the current rules made clear a person s selection for work in the civil service  must be on merit on the basis of fair and open competition .She said   The changes proposed by the government to the summer internship programme would allow the child of a mechanic, an electrician or even possibly a toolmaker to apply, but discriminate against the child of a roofer, a taxi driver or a nurse, who would be deemed ineligible. Quite apart from dramatically reducing the range of talent, does she really believe that this is still a fair and open and indeed a sensible process?  Baroness Gray, the daughter of Irish immigrants in 1950s Tottenham, grew up with a salesman father and a barmaid mother.She joined the civil service straight from school after her father died when she was a teenager.She became a household name as the Partygate investigator, and her critical report into Downing Street lockdown gatherings contributed to Boris Johnson s downfall in 2022.She was poached from the civil service by Labour to lead Sir Keir Starmer s office as the party prepared for government ahead of the 2024 election, but infighting forced her out within 100 days of victory.Since joining the House of Lords she has used her speeches to warn about proposed cuts to the civil service, criticising those who call public servants  pen pushers .Making her maiden speech in the House of Lords, Baroness Gray said that the UK needs  public servants to succeed .

"No chaos  in Reform-run councils, deputy says. Richard Tice says there is no chaos and much success despite two Reform UK councillors quitting. Reform UK s deputy leader Richard Tice has insisted there is no chaos in the councils his party runs and there are plans to deliver  hundreds of millions of pounds  in savings.In an interview with the BBC, Tice dismissed the suggestion that his party had brought chaos to County Durham Council after two of its councillors quit, triggering by-elections and a third was suspended. There s no chaos, there is success. We are saving money, identifying waste and voters like that,  he said. He also said the party was confident of more success in next year s local elections, particularly in north-east England. May 2026 will see all-out council elections in Sunderland, Newcastle, South Tyneside and Gateshead, as well as a third of seats being fought in North Tyneside.Tice said he thought Reform UK was going to do  incredibly well  with ambitions to stand in every seat.  I ve been up in Sunderland recently, so has our chairman Dr David Bull, we are getting massive support and I think people will in a sense want to benefit from the great success we are achieving in County Durham cutting out waste,  he added. One of the party s county councillors, John Bailey, left through ill-health in June.In May Andrew Kilburn had to resign just over a week after his election to be the councillor for Benfieldside, after failing to declare that he worked for the council.The by-elections were estimated to cost around  20,000 each of public money to run.A third councillor has been suspended after allegations emerged about his social media posts that included derogatory references to Reform UK dating to before his election. Paul Bean, who works for the Home Office, is also accused of making comments about asylum seekers which breached impartiality.However, Tice said the party was focused on delivering savings for council taxpayers and was already making major progress. He said the party s plan to reform the way council pension funds were run could save hundreds of millions of pounds in Durham and its other councils, to either cut council tax or invest in services like social care. Pensions UK, which represents the country s pension funds, has questioned the likelihood of such significant savings being made.It said the local government pension scheme was one of the most successful in the world and was already being reformed.It also said policy-proposing changes should be backed up by evidence and detailed plans.Durham County Council is currently consulting on a plan which could see the poorest pay more council tax through changes to a support scheme. A decision is due later this year, but Tice said everyone in the county would gain from plans to cut waste, with the Milburngate development in Durham and a  waste scheme  also being looked at.

"Clegg accuses Vance of  hypocrisy  over free speech criticism. Many senior right-wing US figures attack UK free speech laws while  intimidating and bullying  critics, Sir Nick says. Former UK deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg has accused right-wing US politicians, including JD Vance, of  rank hypocrisy  for attacking UK speech laws while silencing dissent at home.Since coming to office this year, the US vice president has repeatedly criticised measures like the UK s Online Safety Act and claimed free speech in Europe was  in retreat .Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Sir Nick accused Vance of an  outrageous double standard  for attacking UK free speech laws while trying to  intimidate and bully  critics.The ex-Lib Dem leader, who until last year was Mark Zuckerberg s deputy at Meta, warned Silicon Valley s ties with the Trump administration were starting to look like  Chinese-style cooperation . In February, Vance used his first international speech since taking office to berate close US allies over immigration and speech laws.During his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Vance cited the conviction of a British army veteran for silently praying outside an abortion clinic as proof that  basic liberties of religious Britons  were under threat.Sir Nick said he  cannot stand the rank hypocrisy  of senior right-wing American politicians  flying first class or by private jet over to the United Kingdom and declaring that somehow there is excessive censorship in the UK and then flying back to the US to basically intimidate and bully and cow their own opponents .He said the behaviour of many in the Trump administration  is flagrantly contrary to American principles of free expression .Asked if he included JD Vance among these figures, Sir Nick said   That includes them all.  I think it is an outrageous example of double standards. Yet Sir Nick warns the UK is  over-censorious  online, citing police making 30 arrests a day for offensive posts.He warns crackdowns on online  speech that is offensive, unpleasant, vile  but not illegal open the door to political abuse. Part of the definitions of living in a free society is that you can say things that are offensive and other people violently disagree with,  Sir Nick said.Over-censoring offensive but legal speech empowered figures like Nigel Farage who  will get more of a hearing the more imprecise these boundaries are .At the same time, he said age verification rules in the Online Safety Act aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content  did not go far enough . Sir Nick served as deputy PM to David Cameron in 2010 s coalition government, swapped Westminster for Silicon Valley after losing his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour in the 2017 general election.In 2022, he was promoted to a senior role by Zuckerberg, with responsibility for policy as well as communication and a reported bonus of  10m on top of his  2.7m annual salary. But he left the company in January this year, just weeks before Donald Trump returned to the White House, after the president repeatedly accused Meta and other platforms of censorship and silencing conservative speech.Sir Nick used his Newsnight interview to attack Silicon Valley s relationship with Donald Trump, which he said was starting to look like  Chinese-style cooperation .Tech firms were beginning to resemble the  politically directed companies of China,  he argued, despite their criticism of Chinese authoritarianism. Seeing tech bosses like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mr Zuckerberg line up behind Donald Trump at his inauguration in January was  one of the reasons where I thought probably it s time to move on from Silicon Valley . Private sector enterprise and ingenuity and innovation thrives best when it s kept at a certain sort of arm s length from politics and politicians,  he added.Sir Nick, who is promoting his forthcoming book How to Save the Internet, said   There s only one thing worse than having politicians and business people at each other s throats - it s having them in each other s pockets.

"New Green leader Polanski vows to  replace  Starmer s Labour. The London Assembly member beat Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns by a landslide. Zack Polanski has been elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales by a landslide, signalling a clear shift to the left for the party.The London Assembly member beat Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, who were standing on a joint ticket, by 20,411 votes to 3,705.In his victory speech, Polanski promised to build a  green left  to take on Labour, telling Sir Keir Starmer s party   We are here to replace you. His election potentially opens the door to cooperation with the new left-wing party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Polanski, a former actor who was the party s deputy leader, campaigned on an  eco-populism  platform and has promised to make the party  bolder  and more radical in its approach.In his victory speech, he said   If you re feeling hopeless, if you re feeling in despair, if you re feeling politically homeless, there is a political home for you. And I promise you, nothing will make you feel more inspired, more ready to get out there and more like we can turn our country around than joining the Green Party. Asked about a possible collaboration with Corbyn s new left-wing party, he said it was  too soon to talk about joining electoral coalitions , but he was interested in working with  anyone who wants to challenge a failing Labour government and take on fascism and the far right .He added that he was  watching the situation very closely  and would work with Corbyn on policy and initiatives such as a Gaza inquiry being set up by the former Labour leader but his immediate focus was on growing the Green Party. In a post on X, Corbyn congratulated Polanski on a  stunning victory .He added   Real change is coming. I look forward to working with you to create a fairer, kinder world.  Polanski said his aim was to get  at least 30 MPs at the next election  - and ruled out a coalition with Sir Keir s Labour Party. In Keir Starmer we ve seen someone who got elected on the coattails of Jeremy Corbyn, who made lots of promises to protect communities, to bring about a left-wing change in this country, to stand up for some of the poorest communities,  he said. And what we ve had in Keir Starmer is despicable in terms of the politics. It is someone who has sold those communities out. He s not just sold his party out, and the people who voted for him. Unusually among political parties, Green leaders only communicate the policies which are voted on and decided by the membership.Polanski appeared to briefly venture beyond that mandate during the campaign, when he suggested the UK should consider leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  Nato  and move closer to European allies on defence.When asked if he stood by these comments following his win, Polanski said he was not against the current policy, but added that things have changed with Donald Trump s second presidential term. Donald Trump is absolutely out of control and he is threatening to annexe Greenland, so I think... we need to stop relying on that special relationship,  he said.Polanski also turned his fire on Nigel Farage s Reform UK, branding them  charlatans  and insisted the Greens were the real patriots because they welcomed asylum seekers through safe and legal routes. This country needs immigration,  he told cheering supporters. The party said its membership had reached a record high of 68,500 during the leadership campaign, following an influx of new members.During a sometimes fractious campaign, Ramsay and Chowns, who were elected in parts of the country that had traditionally voted Tory, had accused Polanski of risking the party s electoral gains with a  polarising, strident  approach.Polanski paid tribute to his defeated rivals in his victory speech, and the other Green MPs, describing himself as  standing on the shoulders of giants .In a joint statement, Ramsay and Chowns congratulated Polanski on his victory. As MPs, we are fully committed to our crucial role  holding this government to account and championing the policies needed for a fairer, greener and more liveable future,  they said. The party s four MPs will now have to elect one of their number to lead the party in the Commons, as Polanski takes over control of the party as a whole. Labour pointed to Polanski s previous call for the UK to consider leaving the Nato military alliance, as the party congratulated him on his victory in the leadership race.Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said   We are living through serious times and the public rightly expect responsible and measured responses from all political leaders. Zack Polanski must level with the British people as to whether he stands by his recent failure to support continued Nato membership, and what it means for his party s stance on Putin s appalling illegal war in Ukraine. The Labour government s commitment to Nato membership is unshakeable and always will be. Unlike other parties, the Greens normally hold leadership elections every two years.This year s contest was due to have been held in 2024, after Ramsay and his co-leader Carla Denyer were elected for an extraordinary three-year term in 2021, but the poll was delayed in order to avoid a clash with the general election.Denyer decided not to stand for re-election in May this year. The Greens had record success at the general election last summer, going from one to four seats in Parliament and overturning large Labour and Conservative majorities.Together with the Scottish Greens and the Green Party of Northern Ireland, they won 6.7  of the vote.",politics,New Green leader Polanski vows to 'replace' Starmer's Labour,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0d0d08jnjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 15:17:20 GMT",967
"Chris Mason  How Polanski s Green leadership could impact UK politics. Zack Polanski s landslide victory is the latest example of a shake up in the country s politics. Zack Polanski s sweary, brash and blunt victory video on social media said everything about how the Green Party of England and Wales is under new leadership.His landslide victory is the latest case study in how the political kaleidoscope between and within political parties has been given another colourful shake.Disillusionment with those parties perceived as part of the establishment, whatever that is and however people choose to define it, has been a headache first for the Conservatives and now for Labour.But it has been a boon for the plenty of others spared that perception, across the political spectrum.The challenge for Labour in particular, already under the cosh from Reform UK and Nigel Farage, is they now confront a cacophony of blunt-speaking, digitally-savvy communicators to their Left   Jeremy Corbyn, Zarah Sultana and Zack Polanski among them   nibbling away at an already shrivelling supporter base.If we then add in the Gaza independents in Parliament and those beyond who one day hope to join them, that attrition to Sir Keir Starmer s coalition goes further.But Polanski s triumph isn t without challenge for the Greens, or the wider Left.Could they end up cannibalising each other s support?In no time after Polanski s victory, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had publicly heaped praise on him.The new Green leader reciprocated with public praise for Corbyn on Radio 4 shortly afterwards.But could they end up falling out?The former Labour leader and the former Labour, now independent MP Zarah Sultana are in the process of setting up their own party and on the face of it Polanski s Greens and this new outfit could be chasing the very same voters.Maybe they can collaborate, but the potential for awkwardness isn t difficult to spot.Where does all this leave the Green Party?It is a party that has long leant Left, but whose current parliamentary coalition takes in parts of Suffolk and Herefordshire, the seats of Polanski s vanquished rivals.Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, in tone, style and emphasis personify the previously big C and still small C conservatism of their patches.How might folk there react to the sweary bluntness and brash left-wingery of the Green s new front man?After a record-breaking general election result last year, in which they assembled a sufficiently broad coalition of support to win parliamentary seats in Labour-facing urban patches and Conservative-facing rural ones, are they now dispensing with that delicate balance?Outwardly, the answer to that appears to be yes and that worries some in the party.Perhaps a punchily-delivered message can deepen their support in some places.But will it narrow their potential in others?Let s see.",politics,Chris Mason: How Polanski's Green leadership could impact UK politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d0d32q0eno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 22:49:49 GMT",461

A Leeds councillor has been elected joint deputy leader of the Green Party.Mothin Ali, who represents the Gipton and Harehills ward on Leeds City Council, was confirmed in the post alongside Rachel Millward, co-leader of Wealden District Council in Sussex, on Tuesday.Ali became a councillor in May 2024 and immediately hit the headlines for his victory speech, labelling his election a  win for the people of Gaza  before shouting  Allahu Akbar , meaning  God is the greatest  in Arabic. He later apologised for  any upset  caused.Speaking following Tuesday s announcement, Ali said he wanted a  fairer Britain , adding   This country is just not working.

"International students warned not to overstay visas. The Home Office is proactively contacting foreign students to warn them of the consequences of overstaying a visa for the first time. Tens of thousands of foreign students are being contacted directly by the government and told they will be removed from the UK if they overstay their visas.The Home Office launched the new government campaign in response to what it has called an  alarming  spike in the number of international students arriving legally on student visas then claiming asylum when they expire.As part of the campaign, the Home Office has for the first time proactively contacted international students directly by text and email.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC some international students are claiming asylum  even when things haven t changed in their home country . Around 13  of asylum applications in the year to June, around 14,800, came from people in the UK a study visa, according to Home Office data.Pakistan was the most common country of origin, responsible for 5,700 of these applications, followed by students from India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria. Although the number of student visa holders applying for asylum has dropped from the year before, it is nearly six times as many as in 2020, according to the department.The Home Office did not break down how many applications were made from students who overstayed their visa.Clamping down on study as a means to claim asylum has increasingly been a focus for the Home Office in recent months. In May, the department announced it planned to tighten rules that aim to stop migrants using university study as a way to enter the UK.Under the plans, beginning this month, the visa refusal and course completion rates that universities have to meet in order not to risk losing their ability to sponsor future visas are to be made stricter. It comes as the government tries to regain the initiative on migration, following a summer dominated by headlines on small boat arrivals and the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.As MPs returned to Parliament on Monday, Cooper announced new applications for a scheme allowing refugees to bring their family members to the UK would be temporarily suspended. The government is also promising that the first migrant returns under the UK s new  one in, one out  deal with France will begin later this month. The new message campaign will see around 130,000 students and their families receive a message telling them if they have  no legal right to remain  in the country they  must leave .Ten thousand international students whose visas are due to expire have already been contacted directly by text and email - warning them they could be deported.Tens of thousands more will receive the message in the coming months, the BBC understands, to coincide with autumn when applications often increase.The full message will read   If you submit an asylum claim that lacks merit, it will be swiftly and robustly refused.  Any request for asylum support will be assessed against destitution criteria. If you do not meet the criteria, you will not receive support.  If you have no legal right to remain in the UK, you must leave.  If you don t, we will remove you.  Cooper told BBC Breakfast that students are entering the asylum system and sometimes staying there for years, which  causes problems with asylum accommodation and hotels . We obviously will do our bit to support genuine refugees,  she added,  but if nothing has changed in their country, people should not be claiming asylum at the end of a student course. While the political focus this summer has been on people arriving on small boats, a similar number arrive legally with visas, then apply for asylum often when those visas run out. Many of these claims are legitimate, but ministers are worried that too many international students are seeking asylum simply to stay in the country because their leave to remain has run out.According to the Home Office, 43,600 out of 111,084 asylum applications in the year to June came from people arriving on a small boat.But a similar number, 41,100, had travelled to the UK legally through routes such as a work, study, or visitor visa, including the 14,800 on student visas.Earlier this year, the Home Office announced a cut in the amount of time overseas graduates can stay in the UK after their studies   from two years to 18 months.Universities UK, an umbrella group for British universities, said it recognised the government had  raised concerns about the number of asylum claims, and we have discussed this matter with officials .  To make sure universities can continue to play their part, we need improved, real-time data sharing between Home Office and the sector so that universities can respond proactively to any issues as soon as they are identified,  it added.The Refugee Council said the situation in some students  home countries could change  dramatically  after their arrival in the UK.Jon Featonby, the charity s senior policy analyst, said other people seeking asylum only felt safe enough to ask for protection once they reach the UK  because they fear reprisal or surveillance in their home country . It s wrong to suggest that people who arrive on a visa and then apply for asylum are abusing the system and do not have a genuine need for protection,  he added.",politics,International students warned not to overstay visas,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn858lx34vvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 12:51:58 GMT",893
"Reform boss denies press ban applied to councillors. Mick Barton banned the Nottingham Post over a disagreement about a story about local government reorganisation. The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council has denied that his party s councillors were barred from speaking to a local newspaper s reporters.Last week the council told the BBC that Mick Barton had banned the Nottingham Post and its online arm Nottinghamshire Live from speaking to him and other councillors  with immediate effect .It came after a disagreement over a story the publication ran about local government reorganisation, with the council saying  councillor Barton and his colleagues will not be giving interviews .But after a council meeting on Tuesday, Barton has since told the BBC the ban only applied to press releases and him personally.  We haven t got a problem, I ve not got a problem, I m being professional and I hope the Notts Post become professional,  Barton said after the meeting. The ban still stands until they come and apologise. They need to pick the phone up and speak to me. He said he had  never stopped  his councillors from speaking to journalists at the publication. The authority previously said it would stop sending press releases to the publication, and that Barton and his 40 fellow Reform councillors would not give interviews or invite them to council events.A spokesperson for the council said last week that  the ban, which will only be lifted for emergency scenarios like flooding and weather-related cases, incidents at council-run schools, adult social care, or public safety issues, has come into immediate effect .But Barton denied this, and added   I don t know where that s come from. I m the leader, I don t control their lives. If a media person wants to speak to anybody in my group, I can t control that and I wouldn t want to control it. When the BBC referred to the council s statement, Barton said   I ve not printed that, I ve just put a ban on Notts Live, we aren t working with them.  Also included in the ban are BBC-funded journalists who work at the publication as part of the Local Democracy Reporting Service  LDRS .Reporters from Nottinghamshire Live and the LDRS can continue to attend public meetings.The ban has been criticised by Nottinghamshire Live editor Natalie Fahy, who attempted to hand Barton a copy of the Nottingham Post at the start of the meeting on Tuesday, which he refused to accept.The extraordinary council meeting was held earlier for councillors to vote on their preferred option for local government reform in Nottinghamshire.A petition created by the publication, called Reform  Stop hiding from press scrutiny, has gained more than 26,000 signatures. According to the Post, an article written by its agenda editor Oliver Pridmore prompted the ban.The piece - about ongoing discussions over the reorganisation of local government - included a claim that two Reform UK councillors said at a public surgery they could be suspended from their county council group if they did not vote for Barton s preferred model.Pridmore attended the meeting and afterwards, said   We haven t got anything to apologise for, and we stand by the coverage we produced. It s the exact same coverage we provide on any council in our patch. Leader of the opposition, Conservative Sam Smith, added the ban was  totally ludicrous . It shows weak leadership, they are scared of the press asking questions they don t know the answers to,  he said.Before Barton s comments, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice had said if reporters  act as activists , then  maybe we don t have to talk to them .During a series of interviews with BBC local radio stations earlier, BBC Radio Bristol asked Tice if he believes in free speech and  being challenged  in light of the council s Nottinghamshire Live decision.Tice said   There s a difference between the media and people who pretend to be media and act as activists, and that s where we draw the line, and that s a judgment that has been made in Nottinghamshire. He added   I m sure they ll sort it out. But also, you know, freedom of speech means that if someone acts as an activist, then actually maybe we don t have to talk to them - we re talking to lots of other people, we enjoy scrutiny and accountability.

"Chris Mason  Starmer faces pressure to deliver as he tries to strike contrast with Reform. The prime minister is frustrated he hasn t been able to deliver more change up to now.  Delivery, delivery, delivery. The words of the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, about his priorities in his curtain-raising interview for the new political term with Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 live, which you can listen to here.It was a tacit admission that despite campaigning on a platform of  change  before the general election, there is plenty of evidence that plenty of folk think there has been nowhere near enough of it.Or, plenty may have concluded that what has changed has changed in the wrong direction.Sir Keir argues it was always going to take time to get things changing, but he is frustrated he hasn t managed to deliver more of it up to now.Part of his solution is another shake-up of his Downing Street team. You can read more about that from Henry Zeffman here. The other is to set out what he and the government are doing and to make the case that it is better than what he and his ministers are increasingly framing as the likely alternative - Reform UK.Privately, figures in government acknowledge that Reform had a visible and noisy summer.The party set out to try to dominate the political conversation when others often take a break and by and large they achieved that.The prominence of the issue of asylum, particularly the rows about the Bell Hotel in Epping in Essex, gave a salience to a theme Reform regard as their own. And we didn t come this far just to get this far,  a senior Reform figure tells me, as party leader Nigel Farage heads to Washington to rail against the government about the Lucy Connolly case, and then heads to Birmingham on Friday for his party conference.The party is doing all it can to maintain its momentum.So we shouldn t be surprised that barely hours into this new political season and both the prime minister and the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper were each attempting to make a virtue of their approach - and try to contrast it with Reform s.The pitch from them both amounted to arguing that they are assembling what they see as a careful set of thoughtful, workable, iterative steps forward on asylum policy.The new detail this time was the government s decision to suspend family reunion applications from refugees.They contrasted that with what they claim is not only opportunistic rhetoric from Farage, but an attempt to sow grievance without providing solutions.Reform counter that it is only they who are offering solutions that might actually work - such as withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, which both Labour in government now and the Conservatives before them baulked at.This tussle gets to the heart of our politics right now - and in the coming months, even years.Are people running out of patience with a government with a strategy that, until now at least, has demanded just that - patience?And if plenty are, and the opinion polls suggest many are, would they embrace an insurgent, barely tested alternative, Reform UK?These are the questions politics looks set to keep returning to.And, in time, we will get an answer.",politics,Chris Mason: Starmer faces pressure to deliver as he tries to strike contrast with Reform,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jpj8knvn8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:23:02 GMT",549
"Justice secretary to get power to veto sentencing guidance. Shabana Mahmood has introduced a requirement for any new rules to be approved by her. The government is changing the law to stop the Sentencing Council issuing new guidelines to courts in England and Wales without the explicit approval of the justice secretary.Under the new rules, Shabana Mahmood will have veto powers over any new sentencing guidance issued by the independent public body, the Ministry of Justice said.The change comes after a public dispute earlier in the year between the Sentencing Council and the government over pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups.Announcing the new measures, Mahmood said  policy must be set by parliamentarians, who answer to the people . The new measure will be brought in as part of the Sentencing Bill, being introduced in the House of Commons on Tuesday.The Sentencing Council is a non-departmental public body that sets out guidance for courts in England and Wales.Both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice, who is the head of the judiciary, will be given individual powers requiring them both to approve any future guidelines before they can be issued by the Sentencing Council.This means that if either oppose the guidance, it will not be issued.The council will also have to seek approval from the justice secretary to sign off its annual business plan.The Ministry of Justice said the reforms do not interfere with the independence of judges in making individual sentencing decisions. Individual sentencing decisions will always be the responsibility of the independent judiciary   and this is something I will staunchly defend,  Mahmood said in a statement. However, policy must be set by parliamentarians, who answer to the people. It is right that we now have greater democratic and judicial oversight of the direction of the Council s work and the final guidelines they publish. The move forms part of wider changes to sentencing policy, including measures to stop prison overcrowding, such as including Texas-style earned release sentences and tougher community punishment.The new powers come after ministers intervened to block updated Sentencing Council guidance earlier this year, which would have seen judges having to consider the background of offenders from certain minority groups when deciding on a punishment.Under the proposed rules, a pre-sentence report would have usually been necessary before deciding punishment for someone of an ethnic, cultural or faith minority, alongside other groups such as young adults aged 18 to 25, women and pregnant women.Both the opposition and the government criticised the change.Mahmood previously said the proposed guidelines amounted to  differential treatment  because pre-sentence reports were encouraged for some but not others.Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said they were biased  against straight white men  and amounted to  two-tier justice .Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.Mahmood had asked the Council to reconsider its guidance for judges earlier this year, but it rejected her request arguing the revised guideline would ensure courts had the  most comprehensive information available  with which to decide an appropriate punishment.The guidelines were abandoned after ministers actioned an emergency law to override them.",politics,Justice secretary to get power to veto sentencing guidance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn848g3ll09o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 02:23:53 GMT",522
"UK suspends refugee family reunion applications. Yvette Cooper outlines her plans as MPs return to Parliament after a summer of protests at asylum hotels. The government is temporarily suspending new applications for a scheme allowing refugees to bring their family members to the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the move, in force from this week, would mean refugees face the same restrictions as other migrants hoping to bring family to join them in the UK.This generally means someone must earn at least  29,000 a year and provide suitable accommodation, while their family member may need to demonstrate a basic level of English.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said  tweaking the family reunion rules are not enough  to deal with the scale of the UK s  border security crisis . It comes on the day Parliament returned after a summer dominated by criticism over the use of hotels for migrants arriving on small boats. On Monday, Cooper announced the government would temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route that allows those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family with  no conditions .Cooper said the rules  were designed many years ago to help families separated by war, conflict and persecution  but are now out of kilter with the UK s neighbours and restrictions are needed.European countries like Denmark and Switzerland make refugees wait two years before applying to reunite with family, giving them time to find work and housing to support loved ones when they arrive, Cooper said.In contrast, in the UK  those applications come in on average in around a month , often before the refugee even leaves asylum housing, she said.As a result, Cooper said many refugee families are applying to councils for help to stop them falling into homelessness - making up more than a quarter of homelessness cases in some local authorities.Refugees applying to bring family members to the UK will be covered by regular immigration rules, which set several restrictions.Further reforms to family reunion routes will be outlined later this year, with the aim of introducing changes by the spring. The government has been under pressure after a summer of headlines around small boat crossings and protests over asylum-seeker hotels.Responding to the rule changes, Philp said the government s  failure  to tackle the border crisis was driving  protests up and down the country . Where those protests are peaceful, I support them,  he added. If this government were serious about fixing this problem, they would know that little tweaks here and there are not enough,  he said.Philp urged the government to revive the scrapped Rwanda plan, which aimed to deter small boats crossings in the Channel by sending some people who arrived in the UK illegally to the east African country. The government has promised to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029. However, in an interview with the BBC earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he  would like to bring that forward .He told BBC Radio 5Live s Matt Chorley   Local people by and large do not want these hotels in their towns, in their place, and nor do I. But he said the only way to empty them was by working through asylum cases in an  orderly  way, as quickly as possible, and then returning people who should not be in the UK.Cooper said the government was also planning to change the  interpretation  of the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR , an international human rights treaty that has been used by lawyers attempting to halt deportations of failed asylum seekers.There have been growing calls in recent weeks - not only from those on the right, but also from some former Labour ministers - to either withdraw from the convention, or suspend elements of it.The government is adamant it will not do that, but is reviewing how the treaty s rights to family life apply to immigration cases.The Conservatives have called for the ECHR to be  disapplied  from immigration matters and are reviewing whether the UK should quit the treaty entirely.Meanwhile, Reform UK supports leaving the treaty.",politics,UK suspends refugee family reunion applications,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626p66d6jxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:17:20 GMT",685
"Lammy  outraged  by Israel restricting aid into Gaza. The Foreign Secretary pledged  15m more for Gazans through a UK charity and branch of the WHO. The foreign secretary has said he is  outraged by the Israeli government s refusal to allow in sufficient aid  into Gaza, as he announced a further  15m to fund medical assistance in the region.Addressing the House of Commons, David Lammy acknowledged a declaration from the UN-backed hunger monitor the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification  IPC  last month that Gaza is experiencing a  man-made famine . Lammy also reiterated the government s commitment to bring critically injured Gazan children to to the UK for specialist NHS treatment, with the first patients set to arrive in the coming weeks.Israel has called the IPC report  deeply flawed  and called for it to be retracted. Lammy also reiterated the UK s government s commitment to move to  full recognition  of a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly later this month - unless there is a breakthrough on a ceasefire. Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said recognising a Palestinian state  should not happen  while there are hostages held by Hamas, some of whom are approaching 700 days in captivity.In his statement on Monday, Lammy called for a  massive, massive humanitarian response  to prevent more deaths, and for crucial NGOs, humanitarians and health workers to be allowed to distribute stockpiles of aid on Gaza s borders. Lammy s comments to the Commons echoed his response to the IPC s declaration of famine last month, which he described as a  moral outrage . The UN and other aid organisations have reported significant impediments and obstructions in being able to collect and distribute aid in Gaza.In its report last month, the IPC - which is the world s leading hunger monitor - found that half a million people, a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza, are suffering from famine. It also found that starvation is spreading rapidly in Gaza City, with famine expected to affect the rest of the enclave in September.Israel has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.The extra  15m Lammy announced has been pledged through medical aid charity UK-Med and World Health Organization Egypt.Lammy said   We continue to work alongside regional partners, including Egypt and Jordan, of course, to enable the UN and NGOs to ensure aid reaches those most in need. On the evacuation of injured children, Lammy said   It relies entirely on Israeli permissions, and I m pressing the Israeli government for this to happen as quickly as possible. Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.Lammy also condemned the Israeli government for continuing to approve illegal settlements in the West Bank, saying it was  tightening its stranglehold on the Palestinian economy .The International Court of Justice, the UN s top court, has declared Israel s occupation of Palestinian territories to be against international law. Israel has consistently disputed that settlements are against international law.Israel has recently approved an illegal settlement construction in the E1 area east of Jerusalem - a move that would effectively cut off the occupied West Bank from East Jerusalem and divide the territory in two. David Lammy expressed his opposition to this, and said approval of illegal settlements in east Jerusalem  moved the dial  even closer towards recognition of a Palestinian state.",politics,Lammy 'outraged' by Israel restricting aid into Gaza,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d0dyjgy2do?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 20:51:41 GMT",597
"Why Starmer wants No 10 rejig after a year in power. The PM s revamp aims to build clearer structures and bolster economic expertise ahead of the Budget. Many of the names involved in Sir Keir Starmer s Downing Street shake-up are not even household names in Westminster. But the latest moves, announced on Monday as MPs return to Parliament, are a big deal for several reasons.First, in terms of organisational innovation. If you re struggling to recall who was Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister before Darren Jones, the answer is that there wasn t one. The role is a new creation, designed to give Sir Keir Starmer firmer command of the government machine he has complained is sluggish and unwieldy.Bringing an MP into the heart of Downing Street s operations is unusual, if not completely unprecedented - the Conservative MP Steve Barclay was Boris Johnson s chief of staff in his final months as prime minister. For all that innovation, these latest moves are also partly about establishing more conventional - and clearer - structures. This morning there were two directors of communications, and four people who could claim in some sense to be head of policy. Now there is one of each. Reaching for the sort of football analogy the prime minister might enjoy, one government insider said to me   No 10 has been like Sven  Goran-Eriksson s  England team. Lots of midfield talent who couldn t play together. The second significant thing about these changes is the ruthlessness. This is a well-worn theme of Starmer s leadership, but he is willing to demote, sideline or dispense with people who have served him very closely.On the other hand, some of those being sidelined today were appointed not long ago at all by Starmer himself   so, to some of his Labour critics, ruthlessness is just a nice way of saying he is correcting his own errors. Third, there is a pronounced focus throughout the changes on beefing up the economic know-how in 10 Downing Street. Jones has spent the past 14 months as Rachel Reeves s second in command. The civil servant now running Starmer s private office has spent his career at the Treasury. Baroness Shafik, the prime minister s new chief economic adviser, is a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, among other illustrious qualifications.This is a recognition that this autumn s Budget will not just be a defining moment of the next few months but of this entire government, however long it lasts. Some senior government figures are interpreting this as the prime minister wanting to take a bigger personal role in the discussions in the run-up to the Budget. Those around Reeves say that she had been pushing for some time for Starmer to boost his economic team, and that she was heavily involved in discussions with the prime minister about the broader rejig of his staff.Perhaps most importantly, this shake-up is significant for what it says about how Starmer himself sees his premiership having gone so far. It is, implicitly, an admission that the first year and a bit of his tenure has not exactly gone to plan. And this is his attempt to ensure the next year and a bit goes a lot better.The prescription is  delivery .

"Starmer backs Rayner over Hove flat row. The PM says he is  proud  of his deputy as criticism over how much tax she paid on a flat purchase continues. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has backed his deputy Angela Rayner, as she continues to face Tory criticism over the purchase of a flat in Hove.The Daily Telegraph reported she saved  40,000 in stamp duty when buying the  800,000 flat in East Sussex, after allegedly telling tax authorities it was her main home.However, she told the local council it was her second home - and pays a higher level of council tax there as a result. There is no suggestion she has broken any laws, but the Tories have accused her of hypocrisy and called for an investigation by the PM s standards adviser.Sir Keir told the BBC he was  proud  of his deputy and that  talking her down  was  a big mistake . A spokesperson for Rayner previously said she paid  the relevant duty  owed on the Hove property  entirely properly .Asked earlier if Sir Keir had confidence in his deputy, the PM s official spokesman told reporters   Yes, the prime minister works closely with the deputy prime minister... on delivering on the public s priorities. There is a court order which restricts her from providing further information, which she s urgently working on rectifying in the interests of public transparency.  In recent weeks, Rayner has faced negative newspaper stories about her housing and tax affairs.In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live s Matt Chorley, Sir Keir was asked if Rayner was the victim of a sexist and classist  briefing war , as some of her allies have claimed, or whether she has questions to answer.Defending his deputy, the PM said   Angela came from a very humble background, battled all sorts of challenges along the way, and there she is proudly - and I m proud of her - as our deputy prime minister. He described her as a  great story of British success , saying she gave working-class children  a real sense of aspiration .Sir Keir added   Angela has had people briefing against her and talking her down over and over again. It s a mistake, by the way.  Allies of Rayner have said her  primary residence  for council tax purposes remains her family home in her Greater Manchester constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, but that following her divorce she ceased to own a stake in the property.This meant she was able to avoid the higher rate of stamp duty that would have been applicable when buying the Hove flat if it had been classed as a second home, the Telegraph reported. She paid  30,000 in stamp duty on the  800,000 flat in Hove, instead of  70,000, according to the newspaper.Stamp duty is a tax paid when buying a property over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland, with the rate varying depending on how many properties someone owns.In last autumn s Budget, the government increased the additional rate of stamp duty when buying a second home to 5 , on top of the standard rate. The Conservatives have called for the prime minister s independent standards adviser to investigate whether Rayner broke ministerial rules.The party accused her of  hypocritical tax avoidance , while supporting higher taxes on second homes.As secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Rayner is responsible for council tax and housing policy.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said   I think people would appreciate clarity from Angela Rayner. I don t know the details of the house purchases, but the reason why people are asking, as they have been in my constituency, is that they re worried about hypocrisy. The Tories have claimed the deputy PM had breached the Ministerial Code because  her tax affairs are not in good order .Under the rules, ministers are asked to confirm their tax affairs are up to date and consistent with their overarching duty to comply with the law.A spokesperson for Rayner previously said   The deputy prime minister paid the relevant duty owing on the purchase of the Hove property in line with relevant requirements and entirely properly, any suggestion otherwise is entirely without basis.",politics,Starmer backs Rayner over Hove flat row,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy850l982v0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:05:23 GMT",697
"Faisal Islam  Reeves has a bumpy road up to the Budget. The chancellor hits back at speculation over tax rises, but will need to find the money from somewhere. It is going to be a long 12 weeks, critical to the chancellor, the government and the nation s economy.Rachel Reeves chose to talk to me at a Birmingham housebuilding development to launch the Budget process as she tried her hand at some bricklaying. However, the obligatory hard hat might come in rather handy away from the site as the chancellor wanted to get across that the point of her Budget would not just be to  raise enough money  for public services - which is code for tax rises. She wants to be known as a reforming chancellor who made much-needed structural reforms to how the tax system operates, in a bid to boost economic productivity and growth to improve living standards.First and foremost, that requires a reassertion that she is in charge of this process. I will make the decisions,  she said,  in lockstep  with Number 10.Reeves dismisses  50bn  black hole  in UK finances That statement is in a week of economist transfers where the Treasury has become something of a feeder club to Number 10.Off the junior ministers  bench has been Darren Jones, Reeves  former deputy, who has taken up a newly-created role as Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister. Football analogies aside, the immediate challenge facing Reeves is the size of the gap in the public finances.The chancellor chose to dismiss the suggestion of a   50bn black hole , and talk of a need for a visit to the International Monetary Fund to request a bailout.She also savaged some of the Budget speculation over tax rises on property, banks and pensions as not just  wrong  but  irresponsible .The Treasury says it has not been flying kites over the summer. I also put to her the very interesting words of the Office for Budget Responsibility  OBR  in July, on levelling with the public that  promises made are constantly not kept  on tax and spending.There was the mildest air of annoyance with the forecaster whose analyses are so critical to the Budget process. The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce four forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy,  she replied.While the chancellor has been a massive supporter of the OBR, granting it more independence, this nerdy point could reflect some looming tension over its assessment of her economic policies.Expect some considerable haggling with the OBR from the freshly recruited array of high-powered Downing Street economists.Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules around borrowing, she says.But there will be pressure from her backbenchers to fudge them.What spending reductions could be on the cards? Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8 , down.Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics. It s going to be a rough ride to 26 November.",politics,Faisal Islam: Reeves has a bumpy road up to the Budget,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 16:00:57 GMT",570
"Ex-actor Zack Polanski s unusual path to become Green Party s new leader. Zack Polanski has stormed to victory on a platform promising bold communication and  eco-populism . Zack Polanski has stormed to victory in the Green Party leadership election on a platform promising bold communication and  eco-populism .The new leader said he would now  take the fight to Labour , telling Sir Keir Starmer s party   We are here to replace you. While he s made a name for himself as a feisty media performer among the party faithful, he s little known outside the London Assembly, where he is an elected member.Beating two of the party s four MPs to the leadership, the 42-year-old has already faced down the charge that he doesn t have the establishment heft of those elected to Parliament in a first-past-the-post system.His pitch to the membership was to move away from the tried-and-tested, with a decisive shunt to the left and a more confrontational communication style.Polanski has had an unconventional path to politics, previously working as an actor, hypnotherapist and mental health counsellor.A 2013 article in the Sun that still dogs him involved a reporter, who posed as a client, claiming he helped her to boost her bust through the power of thought. Asked about the piece following his win, Polanski said his time as a Harley Street hypnotherapist pre-dated any of his political ambitions and he had immediately apologised.  We are all more than one mistake,  he said, adding that Labour was  terrified  of his popularity if they were  rifling through stories from a long time ago where I was clearly misrepresented .Born in 1982, Polanski grew up in Salford, heading to university in Aberystwyth, in Wales, before ending up in Hackney, east London.He is gay and also Jewish, changing his name from David Paulden when he reached 18 in order to embrace the identity erased by his family s anglicised surname, as well as to differentiate himself from his stepdad, who had the same first name.His first foray into politics was joining the Liberal Democrats, a party he now criticises as being insufficiently left-wing, and standing unsuccessfully for Camden Council and the London Assembly.He joined the Greens in 2017, working as a local party chairman before getting elected to City Hall in 2021 and becoming the party s deputy leader in 2022. As deputy leader, Polanski has played a role in the party s growing electoral success.In last year s general election, the Greens quadrupled their number of MPs to four, with his leadership rivals Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns among those joining Parliament.Caroline Lucas had been the party s sole MP for 14 years, before standing down at last year s election, and she had thrown her weight behind the Ramsay-Chowns joint ticket.While Ramsay and Chowns have been seen as continuity candidates, Polanski wants to move away from the  stats and spreadsheets  style, promising a mass-membership  eco-populist  movement that connects with voters on an emotional level.Key to that approach is Polanski s approval of Nigel Farage s  storytelling  skills, which he told BBC Newsnight could be harnessed to send a different message to a wider audience, including Reform UK supporters.He said the Greens had to  connect with that anger and turn it to hope, turn it to possible solutions .In his  eco-populism  leadership pitch he has linked the climate crisis to inequality and called for radical action,  not briefcase politics , to fix unfair systems.He has promised to lower bills with green energy and nationalised water companies, while also taking the  fight  to Labour, particularly on inequality.The battle on inequality includes his longstanding support for a Universal Basic Income, a small, non-means-tested payment for everyone that covers basic needs. As a former property guardian and long-time renter, Polanski has also campaigned for decent, warm homes for everyone.He has called for the government to take action on what he describes as the genocide in Gaza, as well as being arrested for his activism with environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion.His election potentially opens the door to cooperation with the new party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana.The arrival of a new left-wing party, headed by Corbyn, threatens to take a chunk out of the Green Party s support, polls suggest. But unlike some in the Greens, Polanski views the new party as an opportunity rather than a threat. He has spoken about forging a new  Green left  and of collaborating with Corbyn on policy, although he has stopped short of proposing a formal electoral pact, saying it is  too soon . This is a potential headache for Sir Keir, as he battles to hold on to left-wing voters, many of whom had already deserted Labour for the Greens at the last election.Being bold and radical does not come without risk, as Chowns and Ramsay, who were both elected to Parliament in previously Tory areas, had been keen to point out during the campaign.Jettisoning the careful calibration both those MPs managed to balance to win half the party s Westminster seats from the Conservatives could leave them, and the 3,705 Green members who voted for them, out in the cold.Polanski sought to address these concerns in his victory speech, saying   To those of you who didn t vote for me, this is a democracy. We don t have to agree on everything. We just have to have common cause. But the four Green MPs will now have to elect one of their number to lead their group in the Commons, setting up another potential source of tension.Because of the way the Green Party is structured, with a leadership election every two years, members will get a chance to give their verdict on Polanski s new direction well before the next general election, due in 2029.

"Is Jeremy Corbyn s party about to make a Holyrood breakthrough?. The former Labour leader fancies his chances north of the border, but the clock is ticking when it comes to next May s Holyrood vote. Sometimes the left of Scottish politics can feel like a crowded place.You have the SNP, Labour and the Scottish Greens all claiming to be the natural home for voters who are that way inclined.And that s before you even get into a variety of smaller parties.And now there s  potentially  a new player on the scene   Jeremy Corbyn s latest project.It s not got a permanent name yet, but it s currently calling itself Your Party. And it s being launched with the support of another former Labour MP, Zarah Sultana.Corbyn has said that he fancies his chances in Scotland.He made that comment on a recent visit to Glasgow, where he joined striking workers on a picket line.There was plenty of enthusiasm there for the former Labour leader.But is there space for this party to make a breakthrough at the Holyrood election next year? That s a difficult assessment to make at this point.We don t have any Scotland specific polling on how Your Party is being received by the public here.A couple of Britain-wide polls have put support for the new project at 6  and 4 .That s hardly a political earthquake, but it does show the party is making some sort of impact.Other polls have produced higher results when the option of  a new left-wing party  is included. But this is a slightly vaguer way of phrasing it that pollsters tend to be more sceptical about.What we can t say at this point is how this party could perform in a Holyrood election   we simply don t have the data.The polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice says that research has shown Scotland is slightly more left-wing than England, so perhaps there is scope for a breakthrough? That s echoed by another pollster, Mark Diffley.He says that Scotland s more proportional voting system for Holyrood means there is potentially a gap for a new  radical left  movement.And he points to the Scottish Greens as the party who could be most at risk of leaking votes.Ross Greer, a new co-leader of the Scottish Greens, insists that anyone who wants  to build a more socialist Scotland is a friend and an ally . But he adds that he believes his party has the strongest track record of delivering MSPs who fit this mould. It is far from certain that Your Party will get any kind of foothold in Scottish politics.Jeremy Corbyn may be a big name, but Mark Diffley says there is little to suggest he has personally captured the imagination of the Scottish electorate. He is a figure who doesn t have a history of being particularly popular in Scotland,  Mr Diffley told BBC Scotland News.  I don t think he s said much about Scottish politics in the past.  And while Corbyn had a better than expected result leading Labour in 2017, his share of the vote was much lower in Scotland compared to England and Wales.But there are still some who think this new left party could be what Scottish politics needs.Neil Findlay was a Labour MSP once upon a time. He recently left the party over Sir Keir Starmer s stance on benefits.He now runs a public affairs firm that focuses on progressive causes.His West Lothian office walls make his politics clear  there is a quote from the famous Labour left-winger Tony Benn, various bits of trade union paraphernalia and - you guessed it - a Jeremy Corbyn poster. Neil Findlay thinks Your Party could secure backing from more surprising quarters - Reform supporters.The former MSP says that those inclined to back Nigel Farage s party are not necessarily right-wing.He explains that he sees them as frustrated people  looking for an avenue for their vote because they see the mainstream parties as having let them down .He is not currently involved with Jeremy Corbyn s new project, but he urged the party to get up and running for the Holyrood election next May, calling this  the big opportunity .But does this project not run the risk of splitting the left-wing vote and ultimately making life easier for parties on the right?Mr Findlay says that s an argument deployed by parties  who are very afraid that their vote is in decline and that some new kid on the block could start to muscle in on their territory .",politics,Is Jeremy Corbyn's party about to make a Holyrood breakthrough?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyxpnzzx0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 05:15:38 GMT",756
"What are Rachel Reeves  options on property tax?. Reports suggest the government is considering shaking up the property tax system to raise revenue. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has some big decisions to make ahead of the Budget in November.Economists say she is on track to break her own rules on government borrowing unless she can find billions to make up the difference between the amount being spent on public services and generated through taxes.To fill the gap, reports have suggested the government is considering shaking up stamp duty and other property taxes - having repeatedly ruled out raising income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.These changes could raise billions but also come with a range of downsides. A person s earnings from renting out a home are currently exempt from National Insurance in many cases, but the Resolution Foundation think tank has proposed undoing this.Under the current system, landlords may have to pay the tax if being a landlord is their main jobthey rent out more than one propertythey are buying new properties to rent outIf being a landlord is not your main job, in most cases you probably do not have to pay.The Resolution Foundation, which focuses on low to middle-income households, has suggested all landlords should pay National Insurance at a basic rate of 20  and an additional rate of 8  for property earnings above  50,270 a year.The proposal would not apply to companies that own properties.The Resolution Foundation recommends phasing the introduction of the tax, which it says could eventually raise  3bn a year. According to The Times, the government is currently considering the proposal.The policy has a cheerleader in Torsten Bell, who was chief executive of the Resolution Foundation when it was initially floated as an idea.Bell left the think tank to become a Labour MP in 2024 and is reportedly playing a key role within the Treasury in the run-up to the Budget. Capital gains tax  CGT  is a charge on the increase in the value of an asset when you sell it.It applies to the sale of things like paintings, second homes, and stocks and shares, but main homes are currently exempt from CGT.So, if you bought the main home you live in for  200,000 and sold it for  210,000, you are entitled to all of that  10,000 - barring some exceptions such as for those whose main homes are over 5,000 sq m  just over an acre  or who have let part of it out.The government is considering removing this relief for pricier homes, according to the Times, which would mean those sales would be subject to CGT, the current rates being 24  for higher-rate taxpayers and 18  for lower-rate taxpayers.How much this would raise depends on what the value threshold is for homes to be hit by the tax - in the last financial year, the tax raised  13.3bn.Critics argue that removing CGT relief for higher value home sales would slow down those transactions, meaning it might not raise as much as the government would like.Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberium, told the BBC that axing the relief  would be potentially incredibly lucrative but also incredibly controversial . Another change the government is reportedly considering is the abolition of stamp duty, which is a tax on the purchase of homes.Unlike CGT, this tax does not apply to the change in value of the property but to the value of the property when bought.Those buying homes for less than  125,000 do not pay stamp duty. First-time buyers do not pay stamp duty on properties worth up to  300,000.Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home.What is stamp duty?Colleen Babcock, Rightmove s property expert, says the tax is  a huge barrier to movement, from first-time buyers to downsizers .However, getting rid of stamp duty would also mean lost revenue, with  11.6bn raised from the tax in the last financial year.As such, reports suggest any abolition of stamp duty would come alongside other property tax changes. One such replacement for stamp duty could be a national proportional property tax on homes worth over  500,000.According to a report by Dr Tim Leunig for the centre-right think tank Onward, which is said to be influencing the Treasury s thinking, the tax would be payable by buyers of homes over that threshold but on a yearly basis after purchase rather than upfront.The annual rate would be set by the government, but the report suggests it should be a 0.54  tax levied on home value between  500,000 and  1m when bought, and a higher rate for any home value beyond  1m.For example, if someone bought a property for  600,000, they would only pay the 0.54  rate on  100,000. Meanwhile, people purchasing homes valued under  500,000 would not pay anything.The report said this tax would raise as much as stamp duty each year, but Savills  head of residential research Lucian Cook said a gradual annual levy would not replace the lost revenue that stamp duty upfront payments provide immediately.",politics,What are Rachel Reeves' options on property tax?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k1m56xgjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 28 Aug 2025 12:57:57 GMT",835

"Does Reform pose an existential threat to the Scottish Conservatives?. As a Tory MSP defects, is Reform UK set to replace them on the right of Scottish politics? With eight months still to go until the Holyrood election, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has confidently predicted that the Conservatives will soon cease to be a political force in Scotland.Farage was speaking as he announced that Graham Simpson had joined Reform after becoming the third MSP to quit the Tories in the past four months.It leaves Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay facing enormous questions about the future of his party, which is now consistently trailing Reform in opinion polls.With Reform apparently on track to make a major electoral breakthrough next May   something that seemed unthinkable not so long ago   are the Conservatives facing an existential threat in Scotland from their right-wing rivals? Reform UK has led the Tories in four of the last five Holyrood polls, on both constituency and list voting intention.They had a strong third place finish in the Hamilton by-election in June, winning 26  of the vote to the Conservative 6 , and have had a decent showing in a number of council by-elections.This is part of a wave the party is riding UK-wide, with Nigel Farage s outfit regularly in the lead in Westminster polls.Polling guru Prof Sir John Curtice has said the party  poses a significant threat to the Conservatives and Labour s prospects at Holyrood too .More than a dozen Scottish Tory councillors had already moved across to Reform in advance of Simpson.You can perhaps see why an increasingly embattled Findlay would be tempted to shift his party to the right to combat this threat.He has already aligned with a number of Reform policies, hitting out at net-zero initiatives and describing protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers as  understandable .But such a shift risks alienating the moderate centre-right voter base established under the leadership of Ruth Davidson, which helped the Tories overtake Labour at Holyrood.When Jamie Greene jumped ship for the Lib Dems in April, he complained that the party was becoming  Trump-esque in style and substance .Meanwhile another MSP, Jeremy Balfour, has just opted to go sit as an independent while complaining that the party has lost its small-c conservative identity.That the three departing MSPs have scattered in different directions underlines the challenge facing Findlay.It feels a bit like the way Labour was pulled apart in the aftermath of the 2014 independence referendum, losing support at both ends of the spectrum.And just as the Tories profited from that collapse, Reform are itching to capitalise now. Tory sources cheerfully ripped into Simpson s character in the wake of his defection, saying that  of all our MSPs, they ve got the worst of the lot .But the principle and motivation behind the move might be more worrying to the party than the loss of him personally.Simpson has clearly calculated that he has a better chance of being re-elected next year wearing a turquoise rosette.Specifically, he will be hoping to top Reform s regional list in central Scotland.This is a part of the country where the party has performed well in council by-elections, with a trio of strong third-place finishes in West Lothian  which is joining the electoral region due to boundary changes .Conservatives I ve spoken to are already war-gaming scenarios for next year s election.These invariably involve Reform taking seats on the regional lists - which were fertile ground for the Conservatives in 2021, returning 26 of their 31 MSPs.The approach of targeting the lists was clear from the party s  peach vote Tory  placards - a nod to the colour of the regional ballot papers - alongside the familiar  stop indyref  in May 2021.But some members have complained that the party is now too focused on shoring up support in its rural heartlands in the North East and the Borders, to defend its five constituency seats.Jeremy Balfour was the latest to complain that more urban areas in the central belt were neglected, saying the party has few ideas for cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow. One piece of comfort for Findlay will be that this has happened before.Michelle Ballantyne defected to Reform not that long before the 2021 election, but the party  then under the leadership of Richard Tice  only polled 0.2  of the vote, while the Tories kept all of their 31 seats.Meanwhile in 2016, on the eve of Brexit, Farage s previous vehicle, UKIP, only managed 2  of the vote at Holyrood while the Conservatives climbed to second place.The wider political picture looks markedly different this time round though, and most pollsters agree that the 2025 version of Reform is no paper tiger.The Tories have just been on the wrong end of a Labour landslide at Westminster, and as former leader Jackson Carlaw put it last week, it takes a while before people start to listen to you again after that kind of reversal.A generally scunnered feeling persists among voters, and Reform has capitalised on that with its anti-establishment narrative.And in previous elections, the Tories were able to campaign essentially on a single issue - their opposition to another independence referendum.It is not at all clear that the constitution will define next year s contest, for all that John Swinney says he is targeting an SNP majority to deliver indyref2.Findlay is trying to craft a platform around the idea of  common sense  policies, but he needs to clearly define what his party is offering.Reform will need to do the same thing, and having to defend specific manifesto policies rather than the vibes-based approach they currently take may make life more difficult for Farage.But what is already clear is that there is going to be a huge range of options for voters next May, precipitating an almighty struggle for their support. There are now seven parties represented at Holyrood, and Reform entering the fray is not just a problem for the Tories.Not only is the party picking up votes in places where the Conservatives have never been strong performers, the race for seats is a zero-sum game.Holyrood s system of proportional representation does make it easier for smaller parties to return MSPs.But there are still only so many to go around - seven seats on each of the eight regional lists.If Reform start picking off some of them - and on current polling they should - it would see other parties nudged out as a result.That could mean a straight transfer of seats from the Conservatives or Labour to Reform, but it is not inconceivable that others could be impacted too.The odd seat in Glasgow and Edinburgh aside, the Greens tend to put all of their eggs in the regional list basket.There may be next to no crossover in their voter pool, but given their route to growth would be to secure more than one seat per region they could do without Reform locking some down.The regional ballot is going to be crucial for every party that doesn t sweep up large numbers of constituencies - so essentially all of them - and competition is only increasing.Alba is pinning its hopes of ever making an electoral breakthrough on the lists, while talk continues of Jeremy Corbyn setting up a new party on the left.With a record number of MSPs choosing to step down, Holyrood is guaranteed to look very different after the election.These shifts in party allegiance suggest the make-up of the parliament could be much changed too.",politics,Does Reform pose an existential threat to the Scottish Conservatives?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3523qrl8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 28 Aug 2025 05:24:36 GMT",1244
"How Reform has changed the debate on migration. Labour s ideal way of combating Nigel Farage is by fixing the asylum system and stopping small boats - but the party s strategy is also changing. In politics the summer holidays offer a major opportunity for opposition parties.A quieter news agenda means the chance to break through with policies.Multiple government sources have told me that they think Reform UK has beaten both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the August battle of attracting attention.That may have been helped by Tuesday s finale in Nigel Farage s summer crime campaign  the unveiling of the party s long-awaited illegal immigration strategy.A couple of attendees at the news conference, at an aircraft hangar in Oxfordshire, told me what was most notable was not just the boldness of the policy but quite how much money the party had spent on the event.  It was like a TV variety show,  said one.That suggests the party is continuing to attract donors - helped by opinion polls consistently suggesting that a Farage premiership is possible.Since April, Reform has had a lead over Labour according to these surveys.Research suggests illegal immigration is also among the top issues for voters, although there is evidence that many have a limited understanding of the balance of illegal and legal migration in the UK.So has Nigel Farage changed the debate on immigration? Arguably the rise in small boat crossings since 2018 has been a major factor in crystallizing voters  concerns. It is a very visible, striking, and relatively new form of illegal migration.These arrivals make up just over a third of those claiming asylum in the UK - many others arrive on a visa and then put in a claim.Yet the record numbers of crossings have become emblematic of wider anxiety that the asylum system is not working. And prime ministers have struggled to fix it.Rishi Sunak tried and failed to  stop the boats . Keir Starmer also made a major commitment on immigration - to  smash the gangs .No party seems to be arguing that people making perilous journeys across the English Channel is a good thing. And therefore the UK political debate is focussed on who can solve this issue and how.The solutions on offer from political parties have steadily become more radical in recent months with the Conservatives now examining whether to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.The Labour government is promising to introduce new legislation by the end of the year to tighten the way some of that convention is used in asylum cases to prevent legal delays.Yet Reform is undoubtedly proposing the most radical solution - including leaving the convention altogether. Nigel Farage s plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.In his long political career he has regularly been accused of not being interested in policy detail, and at Tuesday s news conference Farage repeatedly deferred to his colleague Zia Yusaf when questioned about Reform s policy.The policy document handed out to attendees was just four pages long, even if a party source insisted this was just a summary of Reform s - still secret - 100 page plan.Questions will continues to be asked about how Reform intend to deport unaccompanied children, as well as the dangers of returning people to unsafe countries like Afghanistan where they could potentially face torture or death.Farage s response was   The alternative of course is to do nothing  We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.  Labour s ideal way of combating Nigel Farage is fixing the backlogs in the asylum system and stopping small boat arrivals.Yet below the surface the party s strategy for tackling Reform directly is also changing.Some argue that Number 10 remain in the experimentation phase   We throw stuff at them and see what sticks , was how one official described the tactics.But three sources told me the government is consciously working to treat Reform s plans seriously and scrutinise them in detail.As part of that effort the party sent journalists a list of 24 detailed questions for Nigel Farage about his plan ahead of its publication. We want to force Nigel Farage into the policy terrain where he has to dodge questions, and look like every other politician,  said a source.However the Reform leader is well aware that politics is about emotional arguments as well as practical ones. And for now, the polls suggest he is adept at identifying and articulating voters  concerns. Even if solving them may be much more difficult.",politics,How Reform has changed the debate on migration,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c707g9rj9wqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:34:23 GMT",763
"Clarkson for PM, attacks on police dogs  Do Parliament petitions make a difference?. People love signing petitions to get issues they care about debated by MPs - but some can t resist having a laugh. As long as humans have been writing down important information, others have been pulling their leg.So it s no surprise that serious petitions to governments have always been interspersed with tongue-in-cheek campaigns designed to raise a laugh.Some of the greatest civil rights advances started with petitions to government, including the abolition of slavery. It s hard to say the same for the petition to rename raccoons Trash Pandas.As parliament marks the 10th anniversary of its e-petitions system, the enthusiasm for starting and signing petitions shows no sign of abating, with 57  of people saying they had signed some kind of petition more generally in the past year, according to Office for National Statistics survey data in 2022.There s something about the simple act of signing your name to add your support to a cause close to your heart that has allowed the art of petitioning to continue to flourish, even in the digital age.If anything, the launch of Downing Street s own e-petition site in 2006 opened the famous black door of No 10 wider than ever to the public, which inevitably led to a flurry of spoof campaigns.A petition calling for broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson to be made prime minister was quickly backed by more than 50,000 people, although a jokey YouTube response from Downing Street led to Gordon Brown s government dourly being accused of wasting taxpayers  money. By 2011, the new Tory-Lib Dem coalition government decided to move e-petitions from a government website to a parliamentary site and tighten up the rules, but still the joke petitions sneaked through.These included a call to make wrongly describing a casserole with a pastry lid as a pie a criminal offence, demands to bring Bacardi Breezers back to the UK, and to legislate so  Have I Got News for You  is broadcast during political crises.Finally, in 2015, a committee of MPs was set up to decide which petitions should be debated by MPs in Westminster Hall, once they have managed to get more than 100,000 signatures, which few do.This is where backbenchers can sound off about issues that have not made the government agenda, after which a junior minister is sent along to make a speech, praising contributors and usually failing to promise any government action. But that has not stopped the British public from petitioning for such important issues as ensuring UK road signs feature a geometrically correct football, for the Eurovision Song Contest to be made a national holiday, and to recognise Jediism as a religion. One notable success where the law was changed following an e-petition was Finn s Law, for German Shepherd police dog Finn who nearly died from wounds to his skull and chest after he was stabbed with a 30cm  12in  hunting knife while chasing a suspect. Finn s handler Dave Wardell said a colleague launched the petition as the pair were receiving emergency treatment in hospital, calling for those who attack police service animals to receive the same criminal charges as for attacking a police officer.Mr Wardell, who believes his loyal dog  undoubtedly  saved his life, said they hoped the petition would  galvanise  the outpouring of emotion around the attack, although they didn t expect to reach 130,000 signatures in only 11 days.  Without that petition we wouldn t have got the support from MPs in the House of Commons that led to Finn s Law,  he said.  The support just exploded and people would say  I ve never spoken to my MP before and now I feel like I ve got into Westminster . With local groups like schools and Women s Institutes signed up, MPs also got behind the campaign, and the Animal Welfare  Service Animals  Act 2019 came into force within three years. That length of time to get a change in the law is incredibly quick,  Mr Wardell said, adding that he was proud to have left a legacy for Finn and new protection for service animals. Since the parliamentary petitions committee was set up, there have been 162 successful petitions that have ended up with a debate taking place between MPs and, although not binding, the debates remain a way to put pressure on ministers.Only five petitions have been signed by more than a million people in the past decade, including one to  Prevent Donald Trump from making a state visit to the UK  in 2016, with 1.9 million signatures.The biggest e-petitions were both calls to reverse the Brexit decision, with 2016 s  EU Referendum rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum  attracting more than 4.1 million signatures, and 2019 s  Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU  with nearly 6.1 million signatures.The publicity that can come with these larger petitions is not without its risks, and Margaret Georgiadou, the woman behind the biggest ever e-petition, received death threats and abuse from opponents who disagreed with her.None of these petitions were immediately successful, but arguably indicated discontent with how the Conservative government was being run at the time. But a perceived lack of practical change off the back of some petitions has led to multiple people giving up on the system altogether, including Sam Grossick who wants to see the e-petitions site shut down altogether.",politics,"Clarkson for PM, attacks on police dogs: Do Parliament petitions make a difference?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4xqn91rwlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 23:40:38 GMT",901
"How achievable is Reform s plan on migration?. A Reform government could see the UK leaving the European Convention on Human Rights to deliver its plan. Nigel Farage has set out how a Reform government would tackle what he called  uncontrolled illegal migration    with moves including human rights law changes, and mass deportations. But how deliverable are the plans?Let s start with the headline figure of how many people the party badges as illegal migrants  the precise definition of this is up for debate  that it says it will deport.There s no figure in the party s document - but during the event Nigel Farage asked Reform UK chair Zia Yusuf whether it was realistic to deport 500,000-600,000 people within the lifetime of the first Parliament under a Reform UK government, to which he replied  totally, yeah .The party is proposing to create secure facilities to hold 24,000 to be deported every month - that gives us another figure of 288,000 a year, ramping up after 18 months of building work.Removing 6,000 people per week would, using today s operations as a guide, require an average of 1.7 escorting officers per individual removed. When you break that down into departing planes per day, that s within the maths for the party s projection of five flights per day.But these targets are far in excess of what any government has ever achieved. An average of 158 people per flight, plus security, would require the equivalent of five jumbo jets to be available all year around. That per flight number of 158 is three times higher that the numbers currently removed on the most-packed departures.Nobody knows how many people are in the UK without permission or where they are. Evidence shows many of them are in vulnerable situations, including in what amounts to modern day slavery. Reform thinks it can find them with  cutting edge data fusion  and says it would give the state access to a vast range of personal information that it currently cannot obtain without a good reason.Any  police encounter  would involve  mandatory biometric capture , the party document says, which could go far beyond anything that officers can currently do without first arresting you.Reform hopes this information will more quickly identify candidates for removal - but the wide scope of the plan could conflict with the UK s tough data protection and privacy laws.There is also a warning from history, with the government paying out more than  105m in compensation to thousands of people and their families who were caught up in the Windrush scandal. No government has ever tried to build prison-like detention facilities for 24,000 people in 18 months - the time scales envisaged by Reform - or at the cost claimed.For detention facilities to be escape-proof, they have to be the equivalent of what s known as a  Category B  prison - which means there are walls and locked doors, wings and gates everywhere with a suitable level of staffing.Official figures from the current prison programme show that it costs about  500,000 per bed to build such  closed  facilities - and that s broadly the design standard used for immigration removal centres too.That means that if the party in government were to build 24,000 new detention spaces to that standard, it would cost about  12bn.Reform says it will build them for less by creating  modular accommodation  in remote parts of the UK. There are three immediate questions. First, would a modular plan meet the security standards? Second, where would they be built? Thirdly, how would they deal with local planning concerns which have repeatedly massively delayed prison building schemes in the UK? Boris Johnson s government promised 20,000 new prison spaces - but over five years only opened one new prison - partly because of planning disputes.The plan involves creating new laws to fast-track people into detention and removal from the UK - and providing the legislation is correctly worded, there is nothing in principle to say that Parliament could not create such a scheme.But it has been tried before and failed. In 2010 and then in 2015 judges ruled that accelerating failed asylum seekers through to removal was unlawful.The courts found in 2015 that fast-tracking conflicted with one of the UK s basic legal principles  the opportunity to fairly put your case before a court rules against you.So the challenge for Reform is how they deal with the fact that everyone has a right to be heard. One approach would be to say that it does not apply to immigration cases. That would inevitably faced sustained challenge on constitutional principles all the way up to the Supreme Court.Who knows if a carefully worded new law could see that off. But the fact is that good law takes time to write - and Reform would also have to unpick a lot of other laws too.That takes Parliamentary time to get right. Labour s current plan to  smash the gangs  by creating new counter-terrorism style powers to target people smugglers can t be said to be working or not yet because it is still being debated by Parliament. Assuming Reform s plan is bigger than that, experience shows that new laws of this magnitude can take at least a year to become a reality. A new government could, with a mandate and healthy majority, try to push it through faster - but policy advisers in Whitehall would warn ministers that rushing the job means a bad job that could later become unworkable. Part of Reform s argument that it will do more because it will pull out of three treaties including the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR  and the UN Convention Against Torture.A Reform government could indeed do so - although it would lead to some thorny legal problems if a lot of other laws linked to both were not unpicked at the same time.But it s not clear whether such moves would really do as much as Farage suggested.The ECHR is not, for instance, a bar on removing someone from the UK - and there is appetite among some European governments to tinker with it.As for the UN convention on torture, that kind of abuse has been outlawed in the UK, by our own laws, since 1640.If the UK pulled out of treaties, the risk is that our government loses international influence that it has built up over decades.There are two specific consequences of leaving the ECHR.Doing so would breach clearly written guarantees in Northern Ireland s 1998 Good Friday agreement which have been the bedrock of peace and prosperity there since 1998.A Reform government could argue that its proposed Bill of Rights would do the same job - but that would be a tough sell to NI s nationalist community and to Dublin, the co-sponsor and guarantor of the political settlement that largely ended the violence.Separately, there is the question of trade and co-operation with all our nearest neighbours in the EU.The Brexit deal signed by the UK and EU member states says both remain under an  obligation to respect fundamental rights and legal principles as reflected, in particular, in the European Convention on Human Rights .How would the EU react? Would there be an economic consequence, even if that had not been the intention? One of the side-ideas in the plan is to pay people up to  2,500 to leave the UK voluntarily. This is not new and the current scheme saves the government huge sums because paying people to go is cheaper than using the courts. Reform s offer is less than the  3,000 currently on offer.In the year ending June 2025, 26,761 people took up a deal to voluntarily leave the UK. That s 13  up on the previous year and approaching record levels of more than 30,000 returns, seen between 2010 and 2014.Finally, there is the question of  2bn to persuade other countries into returns deals. It s difficult to know how far that cash will travel. Would there be one-off payments or would a government get an annual performance-related pay-out? Rwanda s ministers proved to be such good negotiators they squeezed the UK s wallet for  700m - and received nobody in return.And who would the UK be prepared to hand cash to? Would a Reform government give British taxpayer s money to the Taliban regime with its dire record of the treatment of women? How would such payments work given the UK is a key player in the international sanctions that target its leaders?",politics,How achievable is Reform's plan on migration?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29l0wqlgeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 27 Aug 2025 11:56:03 GMT",1417
"Are young women more left wing than men - and, if so, why?. A divide appears to be opening up between young women and young men in the way they vote and view the world. A political divide appears to be opening up between young women and young men - and no one is really sure why.Polling suggests young men are more likely to vote on the right than their female counterparts, who increasingly tend to view the world through liberal eyes.In a 2025 survey of more than 2,000 16-to-29-year-olds by Focaldata, for the John Smith Centre, 20  of young British women said they were left wing, compared with 13  of young men, although the majority of both identified as neither left or right.At the 2024 general election, 12  of women aged 18 to 24 voted for Reform UK or the Conservatives, compared with 22  of men in that age group, polling from YouGov suggests.Labour was the most popular choice among both sexes, with a slight bias towards women in the youngest age groups. The Green Party polled particularly well with young women, gaining 23 , compared with 12  of 18 to 24-year-old men.The Liberal Democrats did well among this age group, with 16  of the vote among both men and women.The Conservative Party, by contrast, performed badly in this age group, with the majority of its support coming from the over-65s. Reform s support last year also skewed towards older age groups.British politics is more volatile than it has ever been, with the decline of traditional party loyalties and even uncertainty about what counts as  left  and right  any more.But researchers have identified a clear trend, with young people feeling that the two-party Westminster system no longer delivers for them - and a gap between the sexes.Dr Ceri Fowler, a fellow in comparative politics at Oxford University, said   Young people are still more progressive in their attitudes compared to older generations, but when you break that down there is a divide where young men are more right wing and young women more left wing.  And it isn t a divide between the two main parties, it s at the more extreme ends, so either for support by men for Reform, or women for the Greens.  Lucy Thomas, a 19-year-old student in Glasgow, is one of those younger voters who plumped for Labour last year, but does not support them as much now. I grew up with the Conservatives in power and I wasn t happy. When I m voting I m thinking about my local community, people around me, young people as well, I want there to be more opportunities for young people. She says no-one she knows is interested in Labour or the Tories,  they re more interested in Jeremy Corbyn s party, because Gaza is a big issue for young people . Young men are turning towards Reform,  she adds, and although she does not support Nigel Farage s party,  I think that what they are doing on social media is working and not a lot is being done to create a viable opposition  to it .  Daze Aghaji, a 25-year-old environmental activist, says she voted Green in last year s general election but has no strong party allegiance and is interested in the new left wing party being set up by Jeremy Corbyn. Women are leaning further to the left as we are feeling the ways the world isn t functioning properly,  she says. Many  women  are looking for a new progressive future, they re fighting to protect their freedoms, but a large amount of young men are holding on to tradition and that s what drives the gender divide. Many young men are holding tightly to a traditional vision of masculinity, yet the world has shifted in ways that make living by that script increasingly impossible. Joseph Boam, a 22-year-old Reform UK councillor who was previously deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, rejects the idea that Reform is a boys  club.  We have lots of female supporters, which didn t surprise me,  says the former Tory supporter.  My mum and grandma are big Reform supporters, they re always watching GB News. He acknowledges the vital role social media plays for Reform. Reform s smashing it on socials,  he says. You ve got young councillors like me and others using social media to boost the party and get across what we are achieving at a local level, we re reaching real local people where they re actually watching and we re saying all the right things - the truth.  While Reform drew the majority of its support from older age groups at the last election, Nigel Farage s personal brand online has proved a hit on youth-oriented platform TikTok, where he has more than a million followers.The Reform leader has said society is trying to  feminise  young men in a way that made the views of self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate more appealing to them.But at a lunch for political reporters in March, he stressed   I m not a Tate supporter. I m identifying the truth, that young men feel that they re not allowed to be blokes. Boam says young men like him would not normally relate to someone as old as the 61-year-old Farage, but he adds   I ve met him a few times now and he s exactly the same behind closed doors as he is on camera. He s like the bloke you d chat to in the pub, just with fire in his belly and a love for his country. If I had to describe Nigel in one word it would be  genuine .  Reform knows it has to do more to attract female voters as well - although there are already signs the party s gender gap is starting to narrow.Last week it launched a Women for Reform campaign, fronted by its only female MP Sarah Pochin and Dame Andrea Jenkyns, the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.Luke Tryl, from pollsters More in Common, says   While Reform still has a gender gap and its voters remain more male overall, this gender gap has narrowed since the general election, as the party s vote share has expanded - with Gen X women in particular swinging toward Reform. Our data suggests that women, especially those over 45, who are among the most disillusioned with the status quo, could become a critical part of Reform s emerging voter base. So what are the factors behind this apparent divide between right and left among young men and women? Dr Fowler points out that more young women than men go on to higher education, where socially liberal attitudes are more prevalent. Polling from You Gov suggests university graduates are more likely to support left wing parties.Researchers suspect social media plays a role in the gender divide, she adds, but if someone is  feeling disenfranchised with politics both on the left and the right, then if there are alternatives being offered to you on social media it s easier to engage with that .Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at King s College London, says the  gender generation gap is growing . In the past, both men and women were becoming liberal on the issue of gender equality, but there is an increasing number of young men who are hostile to this, believing that feminism has gone too far, potentially drawing them to support populist, radical right parties who more often express support for traditional gender roles. But Mark Brooks, director of policy at the Centre for Policy Research on Men and Boys, a think tank launched earlier this year, with a speech by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, argues that young men are being unfairly singled out, when in fact there is  a general drift away from the two main parties from young men and young women - right and left . I m concerned about the narrative which is that young men are drifting towards the right being seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy where young men are then considered a problem,  he says. One of the most recognised lessons on gender voting patterns coming from the  US  Presidential elections is that the Republicans recognised the plight and disillusionment that some American men, young and old, have. Whilst the Democrats did not recognise or address this at all. He adds   We need more young men in work, more able to get skills to get into work, and more young men to feel like society is on their side.  The political world should talk positively about young men.",politics,"Are young women more left wing than men - and, if so, why?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxg89jzvl1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 23:48:35 GMT",1428
"What are Rachel Reeves  options on property tax?. Reports suggest the government is considering shaking up the property tax system to raise revenue. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has some big decisions to make ahead of the Budget in November.Economists say she is on track to break her own rules on government borrowing unless she can find billions to make up the difference between the amount being spent on public services and generated through taxes.To fill the gap, reports have suggested the government is considering shaking up stamp duty and other property taxes - having repeatedly ruled out raising income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.These changes could raise billions but also come with a range of downsides. A person s earnings from renting out a home are currently exempt from National Insurance in many cases, but the Resolution Foundation think tank has proposed undoing this.Under the current system, landlords may have to pay the tax if being a landlord is their main jobthey rent out more than one propertythey are buying new properties to rent outIf being a landlord is not your main job, in most cases you probably do not have to pay.The Resolution Foundation, which focuses on low to middle-income households, has suggested all landlords should pay National Insurance at a basic rate of 20  and an additional rate of 8  for property earnings above  50,270 a year.The proposal would not apply to companies that own properties.The Resolution Foundation recommends phasing the introduction of the tax, which it says could eventually raise  3bn a year. According to The Times, the government is currently considering the proposal.The policy has a cheerleader in Torsten Bell, who was chief executive of the Resolution Foundation when it was initially floated as an idea.Bell left the think tank to become a Labour MP in 2024 and is reportedly playing a key role within the Treasury in the run-up to the Budget. Capital gains tax  CGT  is a charge on the increase in the value of an asset when you sell it.It applies to the sale of things like paintings, second homes, and stocks and shares, but main homes are currently exempt from CGT.So, if you bought the main home you live in for  200,000 and sold it for  210,000, you are entitled to all of that  10,000 - barring some exceptions such as for those whose main homes are over 5,000 sq m  just over an acre  or who have let part of it out.The government is considering removing this relief for pricier homes, according to the Times, which would mean those sales would be subject to CGT, the current rates being 24  for higher-rate taxpayers and 18  for lower-rate taxpayers.How much this would raise depends on what the value threshold is for homes to be hit by the tax - in the last financial year, the tax raised  13.3bn.Critics argue that removing CGT relief for higher value home sales would slow down those transactions, meaning it might not raise as much as the government would like.Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberium, told the BBC that axing the relief  would be potentially incredibly lucrative but also incredibly controversial . Another change the government is reportedly considering is the abolition of stamp duty, which is a tax on the purchase of homes.Unlike CGT, this tax does not apply to the change in value of the property but to the value of the property when bought.Those buying homes for less than  125,000 do not pay stamp duty. First-time buyers do not pay stamp duty on properties worth up to  300,000.Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home.What is stamp duty?Colleen Babcock, Rightmove s property expert, says the tax is  a huge barrier to movement, from first-time buyers to downsizers .However, getting rid of stamp duty would also mean lost revenue, with  11.6bn raised from the tax in the last financial year.As such, reports suggest any abolition of stamp duty would come alongside other property tax changes. One such replacement for stamp duty could be a national proportional property tax on homes worth over  500,000.According to a report by Dr Tim Leunig for the centre-right think tank Onward, which is said to be influencing the Treasury s thinking, the tax would be payable by buyers of homes over that threshold but on a yearly basis after purchase rather than upfront.The annual rate would be set by the government, but the report suggests it should be a 0.54  tax levied on home value between  500,000 and  1m when bought, and a higher rate for any home value beyond  1m.For example, if someone bought a property for  600,000, they would only pay the 0.54  rate on  100,000. Meanwhile, people purchasing homes valued under  500,000 would not pay anything.The report said this tax would raise as much as stamp duty each year, but Savills  head of residential research Lucian Cook said a gradual annual levy would not replace the lost revenue that stamp duty upfront payments provide immediately.",politics,What are Rachel Reeves' options on property tax?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k1m56xgjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 28 Aug 2025 12:57:57 GMT",835

"Is the government meeting its pledges on illegal immigration and asylum?. BBC Verify examines key areas which the government has promised to make improvements The prime minister has made tackling illegal immigration and  restoring order  to the asylum system a priority for the government.Sir Keir Starmer has promised to  smash the gangs . It follows predecessor Rishi Sunak s pledge to  stop the boats .BBC Verify looks at key government pledges - including tackling small-boat crossings, ending the use of asylum hotels and returning more people with no right to be in the country. Labour promised to  end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds  in its general election manifesto.The government wants to fulfil this pledge by 2029.However, recent figures show there were more asylum seekers staying in hotels in June 2025 compared with June 2024 - a few days before the general election. At the end of June 2025, there were 32,059 people in hotels - up 2,474.Despite the rise over 12 months, the number has fallen by 286 since March 2025.The government does not regularly publish figures on the number of actual hotels in use but government sources have suggested there are 210 asylum hotels, slightly down from 212 in July 2024.The asylum process determines whether a person can remain in the UK because they have a  well-founded fear of persecution  in their home country.Once someone applies for asylum, they gain legal protections while awaiting a decision - including accommodation if they cannot support themselves financially.Almost everyone who arrives by small boat claims asylum - they made up a third of all asylum applications over the past 12 months. Another large group of claimants were people already in the UK who previously entered legally on a student, work or visitor s visa.Since 2020, the government has been increasingly reliant on hotels, partly because the supply of other types of asylum accommodation has not kept up with the numbers arriving in small boats.But using asylum hotels is expensive - costing  5.7m per day in 2024-25. The government has started to save money by adding beds to rooms in hotels to maximise the number of people in each site.The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Bolt, told Parliament in June, that he did not believe the government would meet its pledge   Frankly, I do not think that it will be achieved , he said. They are very large numbers, and it is very hard to see how they are going to be reduced significantly, even over the length of the Parliament.  As of 20 August, 27,997 people had arrived in the UK in small boats in 2025 - up by about 45  compared with the same period in 2024.To reduce the number of crossings, the government has pledged to disrupt the people-smuggling gangs behind them. But it is unclear how the government plans to measure its progress, or when this goal will be met.The Home Office told us data on actions taken by officials to disrupt criminal gangs was  being collected and may be published in the future .There is some information on efforts to prevent small boat crossings by French authorities - who, under a 2023 deal, are receiving  476m from the UK over three years.They say about 33,468 people were prevented from crossing between July 2024 and August 2025. We do not know what happened to them or whether they tried to cross again.There have been high-profile cases of UK-based smugglers being sentenced, including a man who helped smuggle more than 3,000 people.In July, the UK and France agreed to a  one in, one out  pilot. Under the scheme, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in Britain will come the other way.The vast majority of UK immigration is legal - this includes people who have been granted permission to come to work, study, claim asylum or for other authorised purposes.Over the past 12 months, about 49,000 people entered the UK illegally - about 5  of the nearly one million people who immigrated to the UK between July 2024 and June 2025.",politics,Is the government meeting its pledges on illegal immigration and asylum?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dqqj0v1ndo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:48:13 GMT",686
"Energy drinks to be banned for under-16s in England. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said he was acting on concerns for children s health. The government is planning a new law in England to stop anyone under the age of 16 buying energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster and Prime from shops, restaurants, cafes, vending machines and online.Up to a third of UK children are thought to consume these types of drinks every week, despite most supermarkets having already introduced a voluntary ban.Some popular drinks contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee. Excessive consumption is linked to headaches and sleep problems.Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC Radio 4 s Today programme the government had  been called upon  to act by parents, teachers and children.  You can see the impact on the health, concentration and the learning, and that is why we are acting,  he told BBC Breakfast.Too much caffeine can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures.Although rare, there have been some deaths linked to excess caffeine.The sugary versions of the drinks can also cause damage to teeth and contribute to obesity, according to The Association of UK Dieticians.A consultation will now run for 12 weeks to gather evidence from health and education experts as well as the public and retailers and manufacturers who already ban the drinks.While no official date has been set for the ban, Streeting said it will come in  a lot sooner  than the end of this parliament - the deadline Labour had previously promised.Carrera, 18, is part of a youth activist group called Bite Back. She told Today that manufacturers are  clever  by working with influencers, using fun packaging and creating enticing flavours aimed at young people. It s no wonder energy drinks have become the social currency of the playground,  she added.Responding on the programme, Streeting said the government needs to  change with the times  and tackle social media advertising. Lower-caffeine soft drinks, such Diet Coke, are not affected by the ban, and neither are tea and coffee.TV chef Jamie Oliver has repeatedly warned of the dangers and disruption energy drinks can cause, with kids coming into school  bouncing off the walls  having had energy drinks for breakfast. We are talking about three, four shots of espresso in one of these things. Loads of sugar. So an absolute nightmare,  he said in a video posted on X last year.Under current labelling rules, any drink, other than tea or coffee, with over 150mg of caffeine per litre requires a warning label saying   High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women. Young people have smaller bodies and their brains are still developing, which can make them more sensitive to caffeine, say experts.For most adults, up to 400mg of caffeine a day, or about four cups of instant coffee or five cups of tea, is safe. The previous Conservative government had planned to introduced the ban, but scrapped the move in 2022, and said consumption should be a personal choice.Streeting told BBC Breakfast the Tories  called it wrong  and while personal responsibility applies for adults, children need a different approach. He explained that from his office he sees kids leaving school popping into the shop and buying drinks on their breaks and on the way home, with nobody to stop them.Prof Steve Turner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said a ban was the  next logical step  in making children s diets more healthy.And Prof Amelia Lake from Teesside University, who has studied the drinks  impact on young people s lives, said they had  no place  in the diets of children. Our research has shown the significant mental and physical health consequences of children drinking energy drinks. We know these drinks are part of youth culture and associated with sports, gaming, music and more, but there is a lack of clear signalling about their health consequences. But Gavin Partington from the British Soft Drinks Association said manufacturers had already led the way with self regulation.  As with all government policy, it s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that s available,  he added. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also considering a ban.",health,Energy drinks to be banned for under-16s in England,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c707074qdnko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:18:26 GMT",713
"Adults with learning disabilities die 20 years early, report finds. People with learning disabilities and autism die almost 20 years younger than the rest of the population. People with learning disabilities and autism in England are dying almost 20 years younger than the rest of the population, a long-awaited report has said.The annual mortality review commissioned by NHS England was originally meant to be published last year but faced repeated delays.It found 39  of deaths of people with learning disabilities and autism were classed as avoidable in 2023, almost twice as high as the general population. NHS England said it was rolling out more training for staff and identifying patients with learning disabilities earlier so they can be given more appropriate care. The charity Mencap says about 1.5 million people in the UK have a learning disability which it defines as a lifelong reduced intellectual ability, usually identified soon after birth or in the early years.The Learning Disabilities Mortality Review  LeDeR  was created in 2015 to try to understand why so many in that group were dying younger than the wider population and from avoidable causes.The latest research, led by a team at King s College London, looked at data from the deaths of 3,556 adults in 2023 and compared it to previous years.It found that while there had been some improvements, with life expectancy increasing slightly to 62.5 years old, those with learning disabilities and autism were still experiencing significant inequalities. These stark new figures show people with a learning disability are dying a shocking 19.5 years younger than the general population,  said Mencap s chief executive Jon Sparkes. People with a learning disability and their families deserve better. In this day and age, no one should die early because they don t get the right treatment. In 2023 the most common causes of avoidable death in people with learning disabilities were influenza, pneumonia, cancers of the digestive tract and heart disease. David Lodge, 40, lived with multiple learning disabilities including autism, dyspraxia and dysarthria, which prevented him speaking. In January 2022 he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary after he was found severely dehydrated on the floor next to the body of his father Peter who had collapsed and died unexpectedly.His sister Dr Keri Lodge, a consultant psychiatrist, said there was an  overwhelming lack of urgency  when her brother arrived at hospital. Any other 40-year-old man who had not drunk or eaten anything for days would be treated very quickly but with David there was none of that,  she said. There was just this sense of   We will put you in this side room and keep you away.  A later inquest heard there were multiple failings in David s care. He was not offered pain relief, basic examinations were not carried out, and he was transferred to an acute admissions unit instead of intensive care, where he died hours later. They were side-tracked by the fact he had a learning disability,  said Dr Lodge.  I think he would have been treated very differently if that wasn t the case and it s so hard to live with that knowledge. A spokeswoman for Humber Health Partnership, the NHS trust which runs the hospital, apologised to the family and said its processes have been changed to ensure patients with learning disabilities receive compassionate treatment at all times. The latest report found 37  of deaths of people with learning disabilities or autism involved some form of delay in care or treatment, while 28  reported instances where diagnosis and treatment guidelines were not met.Andre Strydom, the report s chief investigator and a professor in intellectual disabilities at King s College London, said progress had been made by the NHS in some areas but there was a need for initiatives such as annual health checks and better support for patients with learning disabilities who are admitted to hospital.Richard Keagan-Bull, a research assistant with a learning disability from Kingston University who helped produce the report, told the BBC he found the findings  really upsetting .  People  with learning disabilities  are still dying quite young in hospitals and are not getting the right support and care,  he said. It could be me or it could be somebody I know and I want these deaths to be taken really seriously. An NHS spokeswoman said the report showed progress was being made but it was clear more needed to be done to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities.  The NHS has rolled out training to more than three million health and care staff to improve the care offered to learning disability and autism patients, and all disabled people have a  reasonable adjustment digital flag  so they are recognised and cared for appropriately when getting NHS support,  she added.In a statement to the House of Commons, health minister Stephen Kinnock described the difference in life expectancy for those with learning disabilities as  unacceptable  but said the number of case reviews which identified good NHS practice had increased by 10  since 2021 and he was committed to driving further improvements.",health,"Adults with learning disabilities die 20 years early, report finds",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c939311dpn1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 16:55:49 GMT",843
"NHS staff called  heartless  over maternity comments. An NHS trust meeting hears staff criticised bereaved families involved in a major maternity review. Staff working for a scandal-hit NHS trust allegedly made  heartless  criticisms about families involved in the largest-ever maternity review and claimed relatives are taking part so they can seek compensation.Families also said they have been accused of grooming other affected families to join senior midwife Donna Ockenden s independent review of maternity services at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust  NUH .The review began three years ago after allegations of harm to babies and mothers, and now involves nearly 2,500 families.Trust chief executive Anthony May described the alleged comments made by staff as  shocking . Speaking at the trust s annual meeting on Wednesday, Mr May said   Some families very recently have fed back to me shocking examples of being stigmatised or gaslit - criticised for either being part of the independent review or for campaigning for better services. Families have heard that they are criticised for being in the review, and that they are in the review on the basis that they are seeking compensation. The families tell me that there are instances where they feel they have reason to believe they can trace that back to colleagues that work in NUH.  Dr Jack and Sarah Hawkins, who both used to work for the trust until their daughter Harriet was stillborn in 2016, have been campaigning to highlight failures at NUH ever since.They described the comments as  horrific  and  unfathomably heartless .Dr Hawkins said   We have been called  compo seekers .  There has been a comment made that people are in this group because they have been groomed by Sarah and I and other people who have been around for a long time, and that has come out of NUH. We want change. We don t have any other reason to be in this fight. The first thing to allow you to change is to recognise that you need to change. And if your attitude is that you don t and that we are, in fact, scamming the system in some way, then it s so disheartening. We re not doing this for any reason other than babies are dying and being harmed and mums are dying and being harmed and families are being ripped apart.  To reduce that down to  they re seeking compensation  is unfathomably heartless. Ms Hawkins said   Life couldn t get any worse... and then they said this about us, and we just feel like these complete, utter monsters. Dr and Ms Hawkins said they  absolutely  think there should be disciplinary action against staff who made the comments. Mr May said he wrote an email to each staff member at the trust to explain that the comments are  not acceptable .He said   I can t attribute it to an individual, and neither did the families, to be fair to them, and it could be on social media, it could be they hear it when they re out and about. No matter where they hear it or where it comes from, it s got to stop. It s absolutely shocking. The families I ve met are some of the most courageous people I ve ever come across, who have not only suffered lifelong trauma, but they re happy to tell their experiences over and over again to try and improve  services . The vast majority of people who work in the trust would never, ever, dream of doing that but if they do, then there are processes that we can use to deal with that. More than 850 members of staff at the trust have come forward to Ms Ockenden s independent review of maternity care.NUH is also being investigated for potential offences of corporate manslaughter over deaths related to maternity services at its hospitals.

"Scottish drug deaths fall but remain worst in Europe. The number of drug deaths is expected to have dropped slightly, but experts warn that any fall will most likely be a blip. Scotland remains the drugs death capital of Europe for the seventh year in a row despite a 13  fall in fatalities, official figures suggest.There were 1,017 drug misuse deaths in 2024, down 155 from the previous year.National Records of Scotland said the latest figure was the lowest annual number since 2017. It brings the total in a decade to 10,884.After adjusting for age, there were 191 drug misuse deaths per million people in Scotland in 2024. According to the most recent European data, the next highest rate was Estonia with 135 deaths per million in 2023.Scottish Drugs Minister Maree Todd said the fall in deaths was welcome but that there was  still work to be done .Experts say they are concerned about the potential for deaths to increase again this year.Kirsten Horsburgh, chief executive of the Scottish Drugs Forum said the recent arrival of deadly synthetic opioids known as nitazenes was  a crisis on top of a crisis. Suspected deaths early in 2025  are already higher than they were last year  she said.What are the figures behind Scotland s drug death toll? This is a crisis with deep roots in the social and economic changes which swept through Scotland in the latter half of the 20th Century as the country s economy shifted away from manufacturing.When the shipyards, steel mills and collieries fell silent, they left a generation of men, whose pride and identity had been bound up with the things they made, struggling to adapt.Society changed rapidly too. The old city slums were cleared, but many people were moved to damp, isolated tower blocks with limited amenities.It was a recipe for joblessness, family breakdown and addiction.In 1972, in a famous speech at the University of Glasgow, the trade unionist Jimmy Reid said Britain s  major social problem  could be summed up in one word - alienation.Men, he said, viewed themselves as  victims of blind economic forces beyond their control  leading to a  feeling of despair and hopelessness that pervades people who feel with justification that they have no real say in shaping or determining their own destinies.  One way alienation found expression, said Reid, was in  those who seek to escape permanently from the reality of society through intoxicants and narcotics. Half a century after his speech, Scotland is still grappling with alienation and still struggling with the scourge of alcohol and drugs.High unemployment in the 1980s was followed by cuts to public spending after the financial crash of 2007 8 and the skyrocketing cost of living this decade.By 2024, people in the most deprived parts of Scotland were 12 times more likely to die from drug misuse than those in the richest areas.For many years this was a particularly male problem. In the early 2000s, men were up to five times more likely to die of an overdose than women although that gap has since narrowed to twice as likely.As demand for drugs rose, so did supply. From 1980, heroin from Afghanistan and Iran began to arrive in Scotland in large quantities, with deadly results.The sharing of dirty needles by injecting drug users and the arrival of HIV led to a public health crisis which was graphically depicted in Irvine Welsh s 1993 novel, Trainspotting, and its film adaptation.That crisis evolved in the decades that followed as it became more common to use cocktails of drugs. In 2024 four in five drug deaths involved at least two substances. Drug overdoses are not the only evidence that Scotland is experiencing a crisis related to alienation. Other so-called deaths of despair are also high.Scotland has a higher rate of suicide than other parts of the UK and some of the highest levels of alcohol-related deaths in Europe.These too are often linked to poverty. In 2023, deaths directly caused by alcohol were 4.5 times higher in the most deprived areas of Scotland than in the least deprived.Taken together, says Annemarie Ward, of the charity Faces and Voices of Recovery UK, Scotland has a  penchant for oblivion .",health,Scottish drug deaths fall but remain worst in Europe,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn2gnkk93o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 09:35:55 GMT",698
"Baby dies of whooping cough after mother not vaccinated while pregnant. The first death from the illness this year comes as vaccination rates among children have declined. A baby whose mother was not vaccinated against whooping cough while pregnant has died after contracting the infection, the UK Health Security Agency  UKHSA  has said.The death, which occurred between January and June 2025, is the first fatal case of whooping cough in the UK this year.It follows government warnings about low vaccine uptake, including among children, as well as an increase in vaccine hesitancy. None of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the uptake target of 95  last year, recent data from the health agency showed. Whooping cough is a bacterial infection of the lungs and airways which can be fatal, particularly for babies. Eleven infants died of the illness in 2024.Pregnant women, as well as infants and young children, are advised to get vaccinated against it. The uptake among pregnant women currently stands at 72.6 .The UKHSA says vaccination during pregnancy, introduced in late 2012, is  key to passively protecting babies  in their first weeks of life. Infants are first offered a jab which protects against whooping cough at eight weeks old.Thirty-three infants have died of the illness since 2013. Of these 27 had mothers who had not received the jab in pregnancy.The UKHSA s deputy director Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said the case was a reminder of  how severe whooping cough can be for very young babies .She continued   Vaccination is the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks.  The health agency and ministers have recently warned of declining vaccine uptake among children.Last year, the share of five-year-olds who had received one dose of the MMR  measles, mumps and rubella  vaccine remained at its lowest level since 2010-11, at 91.9 . The uptake rate for both doses - 83.7  - was at its lowest since 2009-10.The World Health Organization  WHO  recommends at least 95  of children should receive vaccine doses to achieve herd immunity.Poor uptake of the MMR vaccine was blamed for a rise in measles cases earlier this year. In July, a child died at Alder Hey Children s Hospital after contracting the illness.The government this week said all young children in the UK would be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS from January 2026.Health minister Stephen Kinnock told the BBC that the government was concerned about vaccine uptake and hesitancy, which he said had increased after the Covid-19 pandemic.He said campaigns explaining  the benefits of getting vaccinated and the fact that this is 100  safe  would be brought forward as the government sought to  win this battle against the conspiracy theorists .",health,Baby dies of whooping cough after mother not vaccinated while pregnant,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xe5l4mn5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:31:13 GMT",467
"Vaccination plea after baby s  terrifying  measles. Eight areas in the North East and Cumbria have seen a slight or moderate increase in MMR jab rates. Nowhere in the north-east of England and Cumbria has the childhood measles, mumps and rubella  MMR  vaccination rate of 95  needed to achieve the  herd immunity  at which point disease does not spread, latest figures show.Middlesbrough has the lowest rate in the region at 82.5 , but up from 77.9  the previous year.The mother of one child - too young to have the MMR but who could have been protected by herd immunity - said the experience of her having measles at the age of seven months had been  terrifying .Medical director for The North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board, Dr Catherine Monaghan, warned measles was dangerous and  one of the most infectious diseases in the world . Middlesbrough had the region s largest vaccination rate increase in 2024-25 while Cumbria had the highest overall rate in the area but saw it drop slightly from 94.8  in 2023-24 to 94.3 .Of 12 local authority areas in the region, eight have seen a slight or moderate increase but still range between 82  and 94 .Health experts fear a falling vaccination rate could lead to further outbreaks.They say children should have both doses of the MMR jab to be fully protected and prevent the virus being passed on to other children and vulnerable people who have not been able to have it. Singing teacher Scarlett Jones, from Bishop Middleham in County Durham, said her daughter suddenly became seriously ill in August last year. She was just laid on her back, staring at the ceiling, very unresponsive,  the 29-year-old said.The baby s temperature was 39.4C  102.9F , she was becoming more floppy, her eyes were red and swollen, and she was struggling to breathe, she said.Although paramedics arrived within minutes and knew the baby needed to go to hospital, Mrs Jones could not contact her husband Dan, a professional footballer, who was in training. They re not allowed their phones at all,  she said. So I rang the club shop and somebody ran down to the field.  As the baby s temperature continued to rise, doctors first considered sepsis, then meningitis, before she then developed a rash and a consultant found distinctive white spots in her mouth. It took a while for them to diagnose measles as they had never seen a case of it before,  Mrs Jones said.The doctor asked if medical students could be brought in, because they had never seen then disease first hand, she added. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days but can cause serious complications. Dr Monaghan said   Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world and it can be very, very dangerous. It can cause pneumonia, it can also cause a swelling of the brain that can leave you with catastrophic, life changing illnesses - so blindness, deafness. The worst case scenario is you can die. Dr Monaghan said doctors were worried about the resurgence of the virus, with babies and young children, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system at increased risk.The disease was 95-98  preventable with the MMR vaccine, she said.",health,Vaccination plea after baby's 'terrifying' measles,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ej2n0lwzyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 31 Aug 2025 06:15:33 GMT",542
"AI stethoscope could detect major heart conditions in seconds. The new technology could be a  game-changer  resulting in patients being treated sooner, experts say. Stethoscopes powered by artificial intelligence  AI  could help detect three different heart conditions in seconds, researchers say.The original stethoscope, invented in 1816, allows doctors to listen to the internal sounds of a patient s body.A British team conducted a study using a modern version and say they found it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly.The tool could be a  real game-changer  resulting in patients being treated sooner, the researchers say - with plans to roll the device out across the UK following a study involving 205 GP surgeries in west and north-west London. The device replaces the traditional chest piece with a device around the size of a playing card. It uses a microphone to analyse subtle differences in heartbeat and blood flow that the human ear cannot detect.It takes an ECG  electrocardiogram , recording electrical signals from the heart, and sends the information to the cloud to be analysed by AI trained on data from tens of thousands of patients.The study by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust saw more than 12,000 patients from 96 surgeries examined with AI stethoscopes manufactured by US firm Eko Health. They were then compared to patients from 109 GP surgeries where the technology was not used.Those with heart failure were 2.33 times more likely to have it detected within 12 months when examined with the AI stethoscope, researchers said.Abnormal heartbeat patterns, which have no symptoms but can increase stroke risk, were 3.5 times more detectable with the AI stethoscopes, while heart valve disease was 1.9 times more detectable.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation  BHF  and consultant cardiologist, said   This is an elegant example of how the humble stethoscope, invented more than 200 years ago, can be upgraded for the 21st century . Such innovations are vital  because so often this condition is only diagnosed at an advanced stage when patients attend hospital as an emergency , she said. Given an earlier diagnosis, people can access the treatment they need to help them live well for longer. The findings have been presented to thousands of doctors at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world s largest heart conference.There are plans to introduce the new stethoscopes to GP practices in south London, Sussex and Wales.",health,AI stethoscope could detect major heart conditions in seconds,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l748k0y77o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 30 Aug 2025 16:50:15 GMT",412
"Children to be offered chickenpox vaccine on NHS. All young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS from January 2026. All young children in the UK will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS from January next year.It will be given as two doses, at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab which protects against measles, mumps and rubella.A catch up campaign is planned for slightly older children so they don t miss out. Until now, parents who wanted to protect their child against the chickenpox varicella virus, which causes red itchy spots, have usually had to pay up to  200 privately. What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated? Ministers hope offering the vaccine free will not only protect youngsters from the severe, although rare, complications of chickenpox, but also save parents taking time off work to look after a sick child. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, chickenpox causes an estimated  24m in lost income and productivity every year in the UK.Health minister Stephen Kinnock said   We re giving parents the power to protect their children.  This vaccine puts children s health first and gives working families the support they deserve. Why are more people questioning jabs?The announcement comes as new data revealed none of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the 95  uptake target in 2024 25.Some 91.9  of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from 2023 24 and the lowest level since 2010 11, according to the UKHSA. Chickenpox is generally mild but can be very severe for some people. Pregnant women are particularly at risk as it can cause complications for both the mother and her baby.Very young infants and adults are also more likely to experience serious illness compared to children. In rare cases it can cause a swelling of the brain, called encephalitis, an inflammation of the lungs, called pneumonitis, and stroke, which can result in hospitalisation and, in very rare cases, death.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation  JCVI , which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023.Experts say vaccination will dramatically reduce the number of chickenpox cases overall, leading to far fewer of the more serious ones. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency  UKHSA , said vaccination could be  a life saver  for some.Prof Adam Finn, a paediatrician who was a member of the JCVI, said chickenpox is a  rotten illness  that is often thought of as  trivial .The vaccine means chickenpox  is going to be a thing of the past in the near future , he said.The UK has lagged behind other countries in offering the jab, Prof Finn said, including the US, where it was introduced first in the 1990s.He said the main reason for this was because chickenpox  lurks around in your body for the rest of your life  and can later come back as varicella zoster virus  VZV  or shingles. Health experts feared that if chickenpox stopped circulating,  people wouldn t be re-exposed to the virus, their immunity would wane away and we would see more shingles .  Finally, we ve now realised that concern is much, much smaller - it s almost non-existent,  he added. Sarah, who is a mother of two girls, says the vaccine would have helped her young daughters Willow and Mia. Last year they both needed hospital treatment to recover from severe chickenpox. Her youngest, Mia, developed spots  head to toe  and had a skin infection, which made her very unwell. She was just completely out of it...floppy. It was just an awful situation to be in.  It was absolutely terrifying. She said she would advise parents to consider getting the vaccine   I would never want any child or any parent to go through what we ve been through.",health,Children to be offered chickenpox vaccine on NHS,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c860n445vyxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 29 Aug 2025 11:18:31 GMT",659
"Price of Mounjaro to be discounted in UK pharmacies. The rebate allays fears of a 170  price rise but patients are warned the cost of the drug will still jump. The company behind popular weight loss drug Mounjaro has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers which is expected to limit the price increase to consumers from September.Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it was putting up the list price of the drug by as much as 170  which could have meant the cost of the highest dose going up from  122 to  330 per month.But the BBC understands the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for  247.50.Pharmacies and other private weight-loss services will add their own mark-up to consumers, but it means the price rise for patients is unlikely to be as large as initially feared. Eli Lilly originally said the UK price of Mounjaro had to increase to be more in line with higher prices in Europe and the US.US President Donald Trump had previously complained about the high cost of drugs in the US, compared to other countries, and threatened the pharmaceutical industry if they didn t act. The deal does not affect the price the NHS pays, as the service has negotiated its own heavily-discounted rate for those getting the drug on prescription.The weekly injection works by making you feel full so you eat less, and can help people lose 20  of their body weight.Currently there are thought to be around 1.5 million people on weight loss drugs in the UK with more than half of them on Mounjaro. Estimates suggest nine in 10 pay for these drugs privately, buying from online services and high street pharmacies.Eli Lilly said   We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September. We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the list price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients. The price the consumer pays depends on which service they buy the weight loss drug from.Some offer more lifestyle and diet support while on the drug than others.The BBC has spoken to a number of services and the price rise for customers may be kept under 50  for the higher doses and even less for the lower doses.Olivier Picard, of the National Pharmacy Association, said   Pharmacies will do all they can to support patients when prices change. This rebate will mitigate some of the impact of the increase, but patients should still anticipate seeing a rise in prices from 1 September. Pharmacies are working hard to support their patients and explore if there are options to minimise disruption to their treatment programme.",health,Price of Mounjaro to be discounted in UK pharmacies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3ykg4jrro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:02:46 GMT",458
"Seven-week wait for some red flag cancer patients  frustrating . The target set by the Department of Health for patients red flagged for breast cancer to be assessed is 14 days. Some patients who have been red flagged for breast cancer assessments are waiting up to seven weeks to be seen in Northern Ireland.The target set by Northern Ireland s devolved Department of Health  DOH  - which oversees five health and social care trusts - is 14 days.Judith Mullan, a nurse from Cookstown, who went private for an appointment said she was  frustrated  and  let down  by waiting times.The DOH said work is ongoing with trusts to increase capacity through additional clinics and workforce planning. BBC News NI understands that several breast cancer consultants are concerned that waiting times have spiralled since a new regional system for handling referrals was introduced.The system was criticised for creating a postcode lottery network as, depending on a patient s address, some were being seen more quickly than others.Before its introduction, health trusts managed their own red flag referrals. In May, all red flag referrals in the Western Trust were seen within 14 days, making it one of the better performing trusts at meeting its target.However, within weeks of the regional system starting, some patients were waiting up to seven weeks, with the latest data showing 250 patients waited more than 14 days for a red flag breast clinic appointment.More than 1,100 people across Northern Ireland are on a red flag list.One health trust source told BBC News NI that the regional system was proving too complex to manage, with projections of waiting lists rising to 11 weeks by the end of September. Judith Mullan, a nurse from Cookstown, said she visited a GP after discovering a lump in her breast. I have quite an extensive amount of breast cancer in my family,  said Judith.Judith s GP red-flagged her for an appointment, and told her it would be a minimum of an eight week wait.  When my mum had breast cancer, there was a delay in her surgery for two weeks.  Within that two week period, she went from needing a partial mastectomy to having a full mastectomy. Worried that the lump might be cancerous, Judith took out a loan to go private, eventually getting an appointment in Dublin.  I tried to go private in Northern Ireland but the lists, even in the private clinics, were six to eight weeks. The hospital in Dublin gave me an appointment in three days. Judith said she feels  frustrated  and  let down  by the NHS wait times. This has had such a negative impact on my mental health. How many people have to die? How many people have to sit and suffer? Something needs to be done. Judith added   My two daughters are going to be facing the same dilemmas as they grow up. I just don t want them to have to go through the same turmoil that I have.  The Northern Trust said   We very much regret that anyone is waiting longer than the 14 day target for red flag breast assessment referrals. We recognise, however, that the overall waiting time for those awaiting assessment is too long, and acknowledge the stress and anxiety this can cause.",health,Seven-week wait for some red flag cancer patients 'frustrating',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0y317873po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:03:16 GMT",542

"Pine nuts and goat s milk should get allergy labels, say experts. Warnings for some  emerging  food allergens should be added to food packaging, researchers suggest. Allergic reactions to foods such as pine nuts and goat s milk happen frequently enough they may need warning labels, say experts. Food packaging in the UK and EU already lists the most common allergens for people to be aware of, such as egg, peanuts and sesame. But at least four more could be added to the mandatory risk list, according to an article in the journal Clinical   Experimental Allergy.Lead investigator Dr Dominique Sabouraud-Leclerc from the Allergy Vigilance Network said evidence of increased reactions to a wider range of foods suggested it was time to review the list of foods with mandatory labels and consider adding  at least the most severe of these emerging food allergens . The foods the researchers say should be added to the list now are  goat or sheep milkbuckwheatpeas and lentilspine nutsAnd other emerging ones to keep a watch on are alpha-gal, found in red meat such as beef or lambkiwibeehive products, such as wax and pollen, as well as honeyappleThe recommendation comes from experts who looked at food-induced anaphylaxis cases reported in Europe between 2002 2023.Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that is a medical emergency. Symptoms, such as swollen lips and throat and difficulty breathing, can happen very quickly. People who know they are allergic to certain foods can carry an adrenalin auto-injector pen in case they need urgent treatment. The researchers analysed nearly 3,000 cases and 413, including two deaths, were caused by one of the eight emerging food allergies.Based on their frequency, severity, recurrence, and potential for hidden exposure, the top four new ones are goat s and sheep s milk, buckwheat, peas and lentil, and pine nuts.

"Hospital pays out after bacteria-linked deaths. Nine families receive compensation after the outbreak linked to a Cambridge-based hospital. A hospital trust has paid a  six-figure settlement package  in the case of nine patients following an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to its water supply.Three patients died and two of these cases were as a result of complications connected to the outbreak at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, according to lawyers.Lung transplant patients Karen Starling, 54, of Ipswich, died in February 2020, and Anne Martinez, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died in December 2020.Eilish Midlane, the hospital s chief executive, said   Lessons have been learnt  and  regulations revised to seek to avoid a similar occurrence in the UK.  The trust denied liability but resolved each of the claims in out-of-court settlements, which were secured following a civil claim pursued as a group action. Six further patients suffered serious complications that continue to affect them following the outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus  M.abscessus , according to legal firm Irwin Mitchell.Lawyers said the  six-figure settlement package  was agreed in connection with the nine cases.M.abscessus is a bacterial infection which is a particular risk to people who are vulnerable and immunosuppressed, such as lung transplant patients. Solicitor Jatinder Paul said patients were admitted to  this world-renowned hospital... in the hope of a better life . While the surgical care itself hasn t been an issue, the events that unfolded have been devastating for them and their families,  he said. He added large public buildings with complex water systems, such as hospitals, can be at an increased risk of waterborne contamination. Inquests were held in 2022 into the deaths of Mrs Starling and Mrs Martinez, who both underwent double-lung transplants in 2019 and died the following year. Keith Morton, the assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, found that their M. abscessus was a hospital-acquired infection.In a joint statement, Mrs Martinez s sons Tony, 43, and Andrew 38, said   We hoped that when mum underwent her transplant it would be the start of a brighter future.

"Warning issued over branded kids  magnesium gummies. An undeclared drug that can cause drowsiness and headaches has been found in Nutrition Ignition supplements. Parents are being warned to stop using Nutrition Ignition Kids Magnesium Glycinate Gummies, due to them containing an undeclared drug called melatonin that could cause issues for children.Melatonin is a prescription-only medicine, which can cause drowsiness, headaches, dizziness and nausea.Testing of two batches by the UK s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  MHRA  found the products, which have now been pulled from sale, contained between 1.5mg and 1.7mg of melatonin.Anyone who has given the product to a child is advised to speak to a healthcare professional if they notice any adverse side effects, although lasting harm is not expected. Melatonin can be given to children over the age of six for sleep management if other methods have failed.It is often used for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  or delayed sleep wake phase disorder  DSWPD  and for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Children can be prescribed a starting dose of 1mg, up to 5mg of melatonin per day and no serious side effects have been identified in studies of children.The gummies in question were recommended for children above the age of four to help support  calm, focus and digestion .Magnesium glycinate is supposed to help support muscle function, improve sleep quality and regulate the body s nervous system.Parents are being advised to dispose of the item at a local pharmacy and report any side effects to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme.The Nutrition Ignition brand website has now been deleted and products have been removed from online retailers such as Amazon and eBay.As reported by The Guardian in June, the gummy brand was owned by Surrey-based NHS clinical therapy lead Sally Westcott.She was ordered to remove the raspberry-flavoured gummies from sale more than a month ago by the MHRA after they were alerted to the sweets  hidden ingredients by two concerned mothers.The women had the gummies tested when they noticed their young children falling asleep more quickly than usual after consuming them and it was then discovered that they contained melatonin.

"What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself?. How dangerous is UV radiation and how can you protect yourself when levels are high? Warm weather can often bring high levels of ultraviolet  UV  radiation. UV radiation is emitted by the Sun and penetrates the Earth s atmosphere.Some exposure is essential for our wellbeing, but too much can cause skin damage. UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D.This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system. But we need to be careful about how much time we spend in the sunshine, warns Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George s, University of London. Every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer. Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing. UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells.It also plays a substantial role in skin ageing, contributing to wrinkles and loosened folds.UV exposure has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts. Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day.The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around  solar noon , when the sun is at its highest - usually from late morning to early afternoon.The UV Index  or UVI  is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation.Values start at zero and can rise above 10.The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year.Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization  WHO .Majorca in Spain normally hits nine in June and July.But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually get above five, even in summer. According to the WHO, no sun protection is required when levels are  1-2  low  Some sun protection is required when levels are  6-7  high  3-5  medium Extra sun protection is required when UV levels are  11   extremely high  8-10  very high  Children are more sensitive to UV radiation than adults, and therefore require additional protection at lower levels.

Hot weather during the summer can affect anyone, but some people run a greater risk of serious harm.Experts recommend checking on those who may be more vulnerable, such as older people and babies. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.This process can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes.This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include dizzinessnauseafaintingconfusionmuscle crampsheadachesheavy sweatingtirednessIf blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself?What is humidity and why does it make us feel so uncomfortable?How do hot weather health alerts work?When is it too hot to walk your dog? Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we are in a snowstorm or a heatwave.That is the temperature at which our bodies have evolved to work.But as the weather gets hotter, it is harder for the body to keep its core temperature down.It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.

"When is it too hot to walk your dog?. How to make sure your pets are cool and comfortable during periods of hot weather. As temperatures rise across much of the UK, it s not just humans who feel the heat. What can you do to make sure your pets are cool and comfortable? The RSPCA says that exercise is the most frequent trigger of heatstroke for dogs and advises adjusting your routine during hot weather. It says there is no  safe  temperature for walks, as it depends on your dog s breed, age, health and temperament. The charity also recommends the pavement test  if you can t comfortably hold your hand on the ground for five seconds, it s too hot for your dog s paws. If you do walk your dog, go out in the early morning or late evening, look for shaded areas and walk on grass where possible. The charity says these signs could mean your dog is suffering in the heat limping or refusing to walklicking or chewing at their feettheir foot pads are darker in colour or damagedthey have visible blisters or rednessYou should also avoid running or cycling with your dog when it is hot.If your dog is getting less exercise than usual, the RSPCA suggests keeping them engaged at home with puzzle toys or training games. How dog walks can become deadly when the heat rises Some dogs are more at risk of heatstroke than others. This includes those with underlying health conditions or thick coats which can trap heat. Puppies or older dogs may also struggle to regulate their temperature. Dogs pant to keep themselves cool, but the shorter snouts of certain flat-faced breeds like bulldogs and pugs make this difficult. This means they are at particular risk from overheating. According to the PDSA, symptoms of heatstroke include  excessive pantingdrooling or foamingconfusionshakingweakness and collapsevomiting or diarrhoeaseizuresIf you see these signs, first try to cool your dog down as quickly as possible.Move them to a shaded area and slowly pour any available water that s cooler than the dog s temperature over their body, avoiding their head in case they are struggling to breathe. Do not cover them in damp or wet towels as this can trap heat.The faster you can bring their temperature down, the lower the risk of serious injury. Once your pet has started to cool down, contact your vet for guidance and possible further treatment. The RSPCA says it is essential that animals have access to shaded spaces inside and outside. Provide plenty of clean water - you can add ice cubes to their water bowl. Pets may also enjoy frozen edible snacks.Put wet or damp towels underneath their body - but don t place them directly on top.Several pet cooling mats and jackets are available, but make sure you follow the instructions. Products that need to be kept constantly wet can actually make your pet hotter if they dry out. Some animals may enjoy playing with frozen toys, or cooling off in a paddling pool   although you should always supervise pets around water.Keeping dogs and other furry animals like cats well-groomed prevents the build-up of matted fur, which can make it harder for them to stay cool. Make sure any indoor animal cages or fish tanks are not in direct sunlight.Never leave a pet in a locked car, caravan or other vehicle for any length of time, as temperatures can rise quickly to dangerous levels - which can be fatal. Similarly, don t leave animals shut inside conservatories, sheds or greenhouses.You may also want to leave out extra water in your garden for birds, foxes and other wildlife creatures. Dogs and cats can get sunburnt - especially if they are light-coloured or have thin patches of fur. Ears, noses, eyelids and bellies are also vulnerable. Sunburn can be painful for pets, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer. Some active ingredients in human sun cream are toxic to pets so vets recommend using a pet-safe waterproof sunscreen, with an SPF rating of 30 or higher. Some companies sell sunscreen with a bitter taste to stop animals licking it off. The PDSA suggests you apply sunscreen to a small area of skin first, and leave it for 24 hours to ensure the animal does not react.

"What to do if you think someone has heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Know the signs and what to do if someone is unwell in hot weather. During hot weather, it can be easy to overheat, sometimes resulting in heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Heat exhaustion is not usually serious as long as you can cool yourself down - but heatstroke is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment.Some groups, including older adults, young children and people with long-term health conditions can be particularly at risk. The body s ability to regulate temperature is not fully developed in the very young and can be reduced by illness and some medications, while being overweight or obese can also make it harder to cool down.In particular, people taking some medicines for mental health problems are warned they should be extra cautious in hot weather as some antipsychotic medications and antidepressants can make it harder to regulate temperature. Heat exhaustion happens when your body becomes too hot and struggles to regulate its temperature.An obvious sign is excessive sweating, as well as feeling very hot and unwell - which is your body s way of warning you to cool down, fast.Other symptoms include headachedizziness and confusionloss of appetite and feeling sickcramps in the arms, legs and stomachfast breathing or pulsetemperature of 38C or abovebeing very thirstyYoung children, who might not be able to tell you about how they are feeling, may become floppy and sleepy.Heat exhaustion can affect anyone, including fit and healthy people - especially if they have done strenuous exercise in high temperatures or have been drinking alcohol in the sun all day. It can come on quickly, over minutes, or gradually, over hours. Heat exhaustion can turn into heatstroke, which is a medical emergency. It means your body can no longer manage the heat and your core temperature is rising too high.

"What should you look for when choosing sunscreen?. What to look for when choosing sunscreen and how to apply it to get the maximum protection. Temperatures are set to be well above average in many parts of the UK, and UV levels are expected to be high. How can you protect your skin from the sun s rays and what should you do if you get burned? The most prominent number on sunscreen bottles is the sun protection factor or SPF.The higher the number, the greater the protection it offers.SPF tells you how much protection your sunscreen provides from UVB radiation. The number refers to how much UVB it allows in, not how much it blocks.For example, a sunscreen with SPF 15 allows one-fifteenth of the sun s rays to reach your skin, or about 7 .So it filters out about 93  percent of UVB rays while SPF 30 filters about 97 .This means if you could stay in the sun for 10 minutes unprotected without burning, SPF 15 would in theory give you 15 times that protection, or two-and-a-half hours before you would burn. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a  satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing .It says sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours, regardless of its SPF. Many brands also carry a star rating from one to five.This tells you the percentage of UVA radiation that is absorbed by the sunscreen in comparison to how much UVB is absorbed. The more stars the better.UVA and UVB refer to different wavelengths of radiation from the sun that enter the Earth s atmosphere.UVA is associated with ageing of the skin and pigmentation as well as skin cancer. It can affect human skin even through glass.UVB causes sunburn, and is linked to particular types of skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma  the most common type  and malignant melanoma.A low SPF sunscreen could have a high star rating if the ratio of UVA to UVB protection is the same as in a higher SPF product.Ideally, you want a sunscreen with a high SPF and a high star rating. These levels of protection assume sunscreen has been applied in ideal conditions.In reality, most people do not apply sunscreen perfectly, and it can rub off with sweat or while in water. Experts think most people only apply half the recommended quantity.You should not use sunscreen which is past its expiry date as it may be less effective.",health,What should you look for when choosing sunscreen?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lj5r48vmmo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 12:48:03 GMT",418
"Why are pollen levels making hay fever so bad this year?. As pollen levels rise, what are the best ways to treat hay fever symptoms, and other useful advice. Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK over the coming days.The fine powder released by certain grasses, trees and plants can cause chaos for those who are allergic to pollen. Itchy eyes, sneezing, dripping noses, scratchy throats, disrupted sleep and headaches are all signs of hay fever.Around one in five people are allergic to pollen and the main culprit is usually grass, although trees can also trigger symptoms. Early summer is often peak pollen season, when the number of grains of pollen in the air multiplies.The warm weather seen in the UK in 2024 and in the first half of 2025 means conditions have been ideal for birch tree pollen - a major hay fever trigger. Warm, dry days help spread pollen through the air, creating what s been dubbed a  pollen bomb .Cities often have lower pollen counts than in the countryside, but the pollution in urban areas can actually make symptoms worse.In the long term, it s likely that the changing climate will also have an impact on hay fever.Changing temperatures and rainfall could make the pollen season longer and increase the concentration of pollen in the air.Why your eyes are so itchy todayWarm weather means hay fever season has started early There s no cure for hay fever, but there are medicines which can help you feel a bit better.Allergy expert Professor Stephen Till, from Guy s and St Thomas  Hospitals in London, recommends  a cocktail approach , which means taking  antihistamine tablets or drops that don t tend to make you feel sleepy and are long actinga steroid nasal spray, and eye drops They all work in different ways and are all very safe for most people - just go to a pharmacy for advice,  Prof Till says. These products can all be bought over the counter in your local chemist. Some types work better for some people than others, and prices vary, so it s important to find the one that s best for you.Antihistamine medicines help dampen down your body s allergic reaction to pollen. You can start taking them three or four days before pollen counts start to rise.One idea is to keep a diary of symptoms and medicines, so you can tell the pharmacist what you ve already tested out.What works to help with the symptoms of hay fever?How to sleep in the heatWhat do heatwaves do to the body? Avoiding hay fever triggers is essential too, says pharmacist Ashley Cohen from Leeds. I always say it s about good hygiene - pollen sits on your face and arms when you go outside, so have a shower and change your clothes when you come in. And he warns that pets are  brilliant vehicles  for bringing pollen into your house.The NHS also recommends  putting nasal balm or petroleum jelly around your nostrils to trap pollenwearing sunglasses, a mask or a wide-brimmed sun hat to stop pollen getting into your nose and eyesvacuuming and dusting your home regularlytrying out a pollen filter in the air vents of your carAlso, try to avoid cut grass or walking on grasskeeping fresh flowers in the housesmoking or being around smokersdrying clothes outside  Ninety percent of people with hay fever can be managed with over-the-counter medication,  says pharmacist Ashley Cohen.If your hay fever becomes really debilitating, your GP can refer you to a specialist - but that will take a while.Immunotherapy treatment might be available for the worst affected. That s when tiny amounts of pollen are injected into the body over time to get it used to the substance, so that it no longer overreacts.The NHS stopped offering the steroid injection Kenalog years ago for hay fever because of the risk of serious side-effects. The charity Allergy UK does not recommend anyone use it either, and private clinics are no longer allowed to advertise the drug.",health,Why are pollen levels making hay fever so bad this year?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jevn2d1eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 17 Jun 2025 09:17:40 GMT",677

"The trade in US body parts that s completely legal - but ripe for exploitation. Human remains can mean profits. But there is an emotional debate about the ethics of the industry. Harold Dillard was 56 when he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer around his abdomen in November 2009. Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan  Mr Fix It  type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care.In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren t used and return his ashes free of charge. His eyes lit up,  his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers.  He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do. Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away.A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father s head. At the company s warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people.  All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,  a detective wrote at the time.Ms Fasold says she imagined her father s body would be handled with respect - but instead it was  mutilated , she believes. I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn t sleeping. The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment.This was Ms Fasold s first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers  private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres.For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes.Although Ms Fasold didn t realise it at the time, her father s case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death. Since at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors.Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600  whole-body donations , and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so.Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says   A lot of people are either educated or interested in education. But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says  many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free. The Body ShopConversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13 30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West. Like most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled.But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US  a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers, though the firms call themselves  non-transplant tissue banks .Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are medical engineering firms, which use limbs to test products like new hip implants.The for-profit body part trade is effectively outlawed in the UK and other European countries, but looser regulation in the US has allowed the trade to flourish.The largest investigation of its kind - conducted by Reuters journalist Brian Grow, in 2017 - identified 25 for-profit body broking companies in the US. One of them earned  12.5m   9.3m  over three years from the body-part business.Some of those firms are broadly respected, and claim to follow rigorous ethical guidelines.

"Sitting up straight isn t the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips. Here are Dr Xand s three suggestions on how to look after your back without turning into a statue.  Sit up straight!  - we ve all heard that command barked at us many times. For years we ve been told that good posture means standing tall, shoulders back and your spine straight as a rod.But that might not actually be true. According to Dr Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, much of what we think we know about posture is outdated.In fact, trying to hold yourself bolt upright all day could do more harm than good, he told Morning Live.As the end of summer looms and many people return to work and studying, here are his three suggestions to improve your posture and in turn help look after your back. Posture is dynamic, not static. The worst thing you can do is stay locked in one position for hours whether that s being perched at a desk, lounging on the sofa or scrolling on your phone.Dr Xand says the key is to change it up.There are lots of posture corrector straps, back braces and chairs that promise to change your life but  you just need to be moving around in the day .A lumbar cushion or an ergonomic chair can make sitting more comfortable and a wearable posture reminder might nudge you to stop hunching but none of these replace the basics of movement, strength and listening to your body. You can have the best chair, but if you spend eight hours sitting in it you ll still have back pain. Dr Xand also cautions that some back gadgets marketed as improving posture can force you into one position that constrains and restricts your movement and that s the opposite of what you want to be doing. Make sure you stand, stretch and take regular breaks - even small shifts can reset your muscles, he says. Good posture comes from strong muscles, but that doesn t mean you need a gym membership or Olympic ambitions. Dr Xand suggests regular exercises to build a stronger core and back. Simple movements like raising your arms above your head and turning your head from side to side  can lift some tension and help you feel instantly better .  What we want is for our body to support itself,  Dr Xand explains. Exercises like pilates and yoga can be a good way to stretch your body and target specific pain points, he says.The NHS website also suggests simple exercises which can be done at home to improve your strength. Posture isn t just about muscles, it s also about mindset. The way we sit, stand and move often reflects how stressed we re feeling about what we re doing.Hunched shoulders at a laptop can be as much about deadlines as desk set-up so it s important to reflect on your attitude towards work or study.  Pain is not just about muscles, it s emotional and psychological,  explains Dr Xand. He says that previously people would be told to focus on their desk set-up without taking into account that pain can be a result of  stress, the amount of time you re doing your job and whether you do any exercise.  Your seat height is important but other facts are also important,  he adds.So, sometimes fixing your posture is as much about easing your schedule as it is about stretching your spine. In some cases poor posture  not just back pain  can be down to an underlying medical condition and you should check in with your GP if concerned.According to the NHS, if you re suffering from back pain you should try and stay active, take anti-inflammatory medicines and try doing some exercises and stretches. You should see a GP if your back pain doesn t improve after treating it at home for a few weeks or the pain is getting worse over time.",health,Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c890kejpg34o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:07:22 GMT",668
"Will Serena Williams s weight-loss admission help shed stigma of anti-obesity drugs?. Could her comments instil a new sense of confidence in those using the drugs and quieten the critics? Serena Williams, one of the most successful athletes of all time, has spoken out about using weight loss drugs - she says, to lift the  stigma  around using such medication.Will her outspoken comments instil a new sense of confidence in those using the drugs? And could her honesty quieten the critics?The 43-year-old tennis star, who broke records and won 23 grand slam titles through her career, was the embodiment of fitness and athletic prowess. But, after having kids, even she, like so many of us, has admitted to struggling to shift those extra pounds.In the end, Williams told the Today Show on TV in the US, that she had to look at her extra weight as  an opponent . Despite  training five hours a day  and  running, walking, biking, stair climbing,  she couldn t pulverise this adversary like she did to her opponents on the tennis court - so in the end, she says, she had no other choice but to  try something different .Many of her friends were using GLP-1 - the group of medications which help with weight loss, so she decided to try it.Williams is adamant that the medication route - she won t say which brand she is taking - wasn t easy, and certainly not a shortcut to her losing 31lb  14kg  over the past eight months.There is scepticism about the timing of the tennis star s recent transparency - she has just become a spokesperson for Ro, a company which sells GLP-1 brands like Wegovy and Zepbound  known as Mounjaro in the UK  through its weight-loss programme, and her husband is also an investor.Despite this and the potential side effects of taking the medication, her honesty will hit a nerve for many - she says she is speaking out to take away the shame that so many women feel when it comes to using drugs to help them lose weight. Caleb Luna, assistant professor of feminist studies at the University of California, says having someone like Serena Williams speaking out is  a breakthrough .They say it helps silence the critics of how  weight loss is achieved  who say that  people are taking the easy way out  by using weight loss drugs. It gets rid of the stereotype that these drugs are for fat people who are being lazy and incompetent. In that respect it s maybe a good thing. But Caleb also says the revelation about her need to resort to using GLP-1 medication is slightly  terrifying  and makes them feel  a little bit sad . They worry that all it does is belittle hard work and dedication, instead, focussing on appearance and the pressure to look a certain way. She has achieved things that so few people, in our time and throughout history have achieved. But now it just shows how all those accomplishments can be undermined by body size. Scarily, weight loss seems to outshine all those record-breaking achievements.  Williams s weight and her looks have been scrutinised throughout her life. The burden, the pressure to fit in with society s expectations does not diminish no matter how much sporting success an athlete has in their career.And while she may be the most high profile sports star who openly uses weight loss medication, there are many others in the public eye who have spoken out.Oprah Winfrey says she uses GLP-1 as a tool, along with exercise and healthy eating, to stop herself  yo-yoing  with her weight.Actress Whoopi Goldberg says she lost the weight of  two people  after taking the drug, and singer Kelly Clarkson, who says she was  chased  by her  doctor for two years  before she agreed to take it, are among the dozens of stars who have been open about taking the medication. Williams left the world of tennis behind back in 2022, when she played the final match of her career in the US Open, but she is still a powerhouse of strength and has wanted to reach what she describes as her  healthy weight  since the birth of her second child, Adira.In her interview with the Today Show, says she felt like her  body was missing something  and she wasn t able to get down to what she felt comfortable with - despite intense training.Dr Claire Madigan, a senior research associate in behavioural medicine at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says elite athletes can find it hard to lose weight. They are used to consuming a lot of calories and when they leave the sport they can find it difficult - it needs a change in behaviour. Dr Madigan said it was good to see that Williams mentioned her weight loss was not just down to the drug -  she did have to focus on the diet and physical activity .She added   It s great she is talking about how difficult it is to lose weight after having a baby. But she wonders if Williams s message might be lost and even demotivate some women.  The drugs are quite expensive and the average person may think here is an elite athlete, she s got access to the gym, she s got time, she has a nutritionist  and she s had to use GLP-1s .Dr Madigan also expressed concern that the potential side effects of taking the drugs - which can include gastrointestinal problems like vomiting and diarrhoea, and in rare cases, gallbladder and kidney problems - may not have been widely discussed in the publicity surrounding Williams s announcement.Williams says she did not experience any side effects, and told Women s Health magazine that she is finally seeing the benefits of all her hard work at the gym. My joints are a lot better,  she says,  I just had my check-up, and the doctor said everything - including my blood sugar levels - looked great. And, even though, she s no longer breaking new ground on the tennis courts, she is still smashing her own records, with the help, she says of weight loss drugs. She s currently training for a half marathon. I am running farther than I ever have,  she says proudly.Additional reporting by Alex Kleiderman",health,Will Serena Williams's weight-loss admission help shed stigma of anti-obesity drugs?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8de89lg21jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:34:35 GMT",1056
"Lucy Letby s new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe?. Barrister Mark McDonald claims to have the backing of a panel of world class experts who say there is no evidence any babies were deliberately harmed Listen to Jonathan read this article.When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. In one, the question of her guilt is settled. She is a monster who murdered seven babies and attempted to murder seven more while she was a nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016.In the other universe, Letby is the victim of a flawed criminal justice system in which unreliable medical evidence was used to condemn and imprison an innocent woman. This is what Letby s barrister Mark McDonald argues. He says he has the backing of a panel of the best experts in the world who say there is no evidence any babies were deliberately harmed.These extremes are both disturbing and bewildering. One of them is wrong - but which? Who should we believe? The families of the infants say there is no doubt. Letby was convicted after a 10-month trial by a jury that had considered a vast range of evidence. They say Letby s defenders are picking on small bits of evidence out of context and that the constant questioning of her guilt is deeply distressing.I have spent almost three years investigating the Letby case - in that time I have made three Panorama documentaries and cowritten a book on the subject with my colleague Judith Moritz. Yet, if true, the new evidence, presented by Mark McDonald in a series of high-profile press conferences and media releases, is shocking.According to his experts, the prosecution expert medical case is unreliable. Mark McDonald has not released the panel s full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission  CCRC , the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby s case, but he has released summaries of the panel s findings. Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. That is a good indication of where the strongest medical evidence might lie.To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it s worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous  that of Baby O. Baby O was born in June 2016, one of triplet brothers. At Letby s trial, the jury was told that his death was in part the result of liver injuries, which the prosecution pathologist described as impact-type injuries - similar to those in a car accident.As in other cases for which Letby was convicted, the prosecution said circumstantial evidence also tied her to the crime. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O s post-mortem report, says it was  unlikely  Baby O s liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. You can t completely rule out the possibility,  says the pathologist, who does not want to be identified.  But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don t fit with that explanation. Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O s liver injuries, then why did he die?",health,Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed.

Well, that s where things can get complicated, as each brand takes a different approach.Along with Trip s Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including Lion s Mane extract   a type of mushroom found in east Asian countriesL-theanine   an amino acid found primarily in green and black teaAshwagandha   a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and EuropeMagnesium   a mineral the human body needs to function properlyThese supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress.But how robust is the evidence for that? It s tricky because there are many studies of varying credibility each suggesting different levels of efficacy.Trip s advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency s  ASA  code, with the ASA ruling that Trip s claims their drinks could  prevent, treat or cure disease  were a step too far.Trip told BBC News the ruling related to  a single page on the website  and it has made the  changes requested . It says it s confident its ingredients permit the use of the word  calm  which is  widely and lawfully used by many brands . Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. She highlights a growing body of evidence around the funghi Lion s Mane, but says there are no conclusive findings about whether it can have any impact - as yet. The research is still very much in its infancy,  she says.  In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg - that s at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks. Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they re not always front and centre in the research. The lack of research that includes female participants is partly down to menstrual cycles and fluctuating hormones, making it more  complicated to track , Ms Patel explains.But these drinks can make a good alternative to drinking alcohol she says, and she has clients who have made the switch from having a wine or a gin and tonic every night to opening a can of one of these drinks to help them unwind. I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option.  Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population.If you enjoy the taste,  crack on , Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you re probably best saving your  2 or  3 and putting it towards a  therapy session or a massage at the end of the month . A trace of Lion s Mane or Ashgawanda in a fizzy drink is not going to make any difference,  she adds.Emily May, 25, first discovered these drinks at Glastonbury a couple of years ago. She s not overly bothered about trying to reach a state of zen through them - she just likes the taste. I m ADHD,  Emily says,  so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down.  There is a fine line between advertising that a product will give you a feeling of calm and quiet, and claiming these kinds of drinks will help with mental health problems.Psychologist Natasha Tiwari says mental health and well-being are  increasingly conflated  in the wellness sector, creating a  toxic mix . There can be a positive - yet temporary - change in mood and consumers might feel a buzz, she says, not because of the ingredients necessarily, but because  everything around the experience of the product is real . So you ve bought a drink which, let s say, is a little bit pricier than the alternatives in the market. Therefore you make a commitment to sit down quietly and enjoy it nicely,  she says.  You look at the branding - which is lovely and calming - you re processing your environment in the moment, and then actually what you re experiencing truly is a calm moment in your otherwise busy day. That s not fake. And it s that little window of peace that Lucy and Serena yearn for - and for a few minutes a fizzy drink in a can gives them that, whether the science really agrees, or not.BBC News contacted all the brands mentioned in this article. Grass Co told us it s their mission  to deliver high-strength natural adaptogen and vitamin-packed blends formulated by experts... which are supported by approved health claims. Goodrays said it wasn t  offering a panacea , but that it was  certainly offering a healthier alternative  with the  best efficacy possible .Additional reporting by Megan Fisher",health,Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdw0y4q7wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 23:37:41 GMT",1189
"A walk-in fishermen s clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS. Tom Parker was treated in one of 70 harbour health clinics after breaking his fibula fishing at sea. Tom Parker was working alone three miles  4.8km  off the Devon coast when his fishing boat hit a wave and lurched to one side. I was pulling one of the ropes and I slipped and fell,  he says.  I had this really, really bad pain in my ankle. So much so, I couldn t get up off the floor. He didn t know it at the time, but Tom, 37, had broken his fibula and badly damaged his ankle ligaments.He somehow hauled in his fishing gear and made it to hospital to get patched up, but months after the accident his wound just wouldn t heal properly.It was only after he turned up at an innovative clinic on the quayside in Brixham that he was put on strong antibiotics and told he needed a second operation. Without that service, I would have probably ended up with my leg turning septic and I m not too sure what would have happened after that,  he says.Under a 10-year plan, published last month, health officials said the NHS in England needed to undergo a radical shift, away from hospitals to community care, and away from treating sickness to preventing it in the first place.There are already small-scale examples of that approach in action across the country. So what can we learn from the Brixham model and how can the idea of targeted, local care be extended to treat millions more NHS patients? On a clear summer morning a spare room in the trawler agent s offices in Brixham harbour is quickly being converted into a temporary health clinic.Blue screens are dragged across to split up the space  a makeshift reception at the front and then just enough room to cram in two GPs, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, two nurses and someone organising prostate cancer tests.There s a steady line of port workers coming in, from buyers in the fish market next door to crews from the trawlers in the harbour. The skippers of the boats and the whole fishing community now know exactly where to find us,  says Dr James Gunning, the local NHS GP in charge of the clinic that day. They re a community that fits into health inequalities, where a population either can t access, or struggles to access, normal NHS services. Staff working on the project start early in the morning, walking around the docks and coaxing workers off the boats with promises of free health screenings and physio. Fishermen don t have nine-to-five jobs, they don t have lunchtime where they can just pop off their fishing boat and to the GP s office, and so it s really important that we take those services to them,  says Sandra Welch, chief executive of the Seafarers Hospital Society, which runs the initiative along with another charity, the Fishermen s Mission.A pop-up Seafit clinic operates every three months in Brixham and at similar sites at ports across the UK, including Folkestone, Peterhead and Kilkeel in Northern Ireland.Some services have started to expand and now offer skin cancer checks, mobile dental services and access to mental health counselling. In its 10-year plan the NHS accepts that those who live in coastal and rural areas are more likely to experience worse health outcomes and to die younger. Seaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs, while at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving staffing gaps where they are needed most.An analysis of hospital statistics by the BBC suggests NHS trusts in England treating coastal communities tend to have higher than average wait times for both emergency care and appointments booked in advance, like surgery. The answer, according to NHS bosses and the Westminster government, is to shift as much treatment as possible out of those expensive hospitals.Under the 10-year plan a network of 300 neighbourhood health centres will be opened across England, starting in areas with the lowest healthy life expectancy. The sites, which should eventually be open 12 hours a day, six days a week, will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, social care workers, pharmacists, mental health specialists and other medics.The big idea, as with the Brixham fishermen s clinic, is to better tailor health services to local communities, and offer people more checks and tests to stop them falling sick in the first place.Much of this might feel very familiar.Similar ambitions were set out by ministers in 2019, 2015 and even by the Blair government back in the early 2000s. Despite being the right aim, none of those truly delivered,  says Luisa Pettigrew, a GP and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation think tank. Moving money out of hospitals and into community services is hard to do. You need the upfront investment and the results might not be visible for five or 10 years, in some cases longer. Healthcare unions have also questioned how the new centres will be staffed, saying doctors  must not be moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder . The medics working in Brixham though are convinced their local, preventative approach can benefit not just the fishing community but the wider health service.  We ve managed to find new diabetic patients who otherwise may have gone on to develop more serious disease,  says Dr Gunning.  We ve picked out others with cardiovascular disease, and those with high blood pressure. So we would certainly hope we can prevent more costly illness from developing. Rob Caunter, who finally retired from the fish market this year, is just finishing his radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. The 66-year-old, who has a family history of the disease, was diagnosed after staff at the clinic convinced him to take a blood test. I was gobsmacked really because I didn t think there was anything wrong with me,  he says.  If I never went for the checks, I don t think I would be here today. So it was a real godsend for them to come down to the quay.",health,A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21z711g59o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 23:01:41 GMT",1042
"Could RFK Jr s move to pull mRNA vaccine funding be a huge miscalculation?. The US is withdrawing  500m for vaccines for diseases like flu and Covid. Health correspondent James Gallagher asks if it s the right call. mRNA vaccines were heralded as a medical marvel that saved lives during the Covid pandemic, but now the US is pulling back from researching them.US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has cancelled 22 projects - worth  500m   376m  in funding   for tackling infections such as Covid and flu.So does Kennedy - probably the country s most famous vaccine sceptic   have a point, or is he making a monumental miscalculation?Prof Adam Finn, vaccine researcher at the University of Bristol, says  it s a bit of both  but ditching mRNA technology is  stupid  and potentially a  catastrophic error .Let s unpick why.Kennedy says he has reviewed the science on mRNA vaccines, concluding that the  data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu .Instead, he says, he would shift funding to  safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate .So are mRNA vaccines safe? Are they effective? Would other vaccine technologies be better?And another question is where should mRNA vaccines fit into the pantheon of other vaccine technologies - because there are many Inactivated vaccines use the original virus or bacterium, kill it, and use that to train the immune system - such as the annual flu shotAttenuated vaccines do not kill the infectious agent, but make it weaker so it causes a mild infection - such as the MMR  measles, mumps and rubella  vaccineConjugate vaccines use bits of protein or sugar from a bug, so it triggers an immune response without causing an infection - like for types of meningitis mRNA vaccines use a fragment of genetic code that temporarily instructs the body to make parts of a virus, and the immune system reacts to thatEach has advantages and disadvantages, but Prof Finn argues we  overhyped  mRNA vaccines during the pandemic to the exclusion of other approaches, and now there is a process of adjusting. But to swing the pendulum so far that mRNA is useless and has no value and should not be developed or understood better is equally stupid, it did do remarkable things,  he says. Full story  RFK Jr cancels  500m in funding for mRNA vaccinesBBC Verify  Fact-checking RFK Jr s views on health policy The claim that mRNA vaccines do not protect against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu  just isn t true , says Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Vaccine Group, who is soon stepping down as the head of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation  JCVI , which advises the UK government.The vaccines were shown to provide protection   keeping people alive and out of hospital   in both clinical trials and then during intense monitoring of how the vaccines performed when they were rolled out around the world.In the first year of vaccination during the Covid pandemic, it was estimated that the Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine alone saved nearly 6 million lives. Against that there were a small number of cases of inflammation of heart tissue   called myocarditis   particularly in young men. Very rare side effects should be balanced against the huge benefit of the technology,  says Prof Pollard.The pandemic was an era when the world was single-mindedly focused on Covid and the rollout of vaccines was monitored intensely. The consensus opinion remains they did overwhelmingly more good than harm.But that does not mean they are a perfect technology. The mRNA Covid vaccines train the immune system to target just one protein out of the whole virus. If that protein in the coronavirus changes or mutates then the body s protection is lessened.We have seen the consequences of that   immunity wanes and the vaccines need to be updated.One theoretical argument is that a different vaccine approach   such as using the whole virus   would give better protection, as the immune system would have more to target.However, Prof Pollard says the mRNA vaccines performed better than the inactivated ones when tackling Covid.He says that is probably down to the way they are made - and the fact that the process of killing the virus also  changes the viral proteins so there is less stimulation of the immune system  in comparison with mRNA vaccines.The need to update vaccines is not a failing of mRNA technology that can be easily solved by pivoting from one technology to another - instead, it is down to the fundamental nature of some viruses.The same measles or HPV  human papilloma virus  vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus s genetic codes are more stable in each case. But some viruses live in a perpetual state of flux.Flu, for example, is not one virus - but instead a constantly-shifting target. At any time, one strain will be in the ascendancy and be the most likely to cause trouble in winter.In flu, the inactivated flu injection that is given to adults is updated every year - as is the live vaccine that is given to children as a nasal spray. A future mRNA form of flu vaccine would work the same way. The point about keeping up with variants is about all technologies, not just mRNA,  says Prof Pollard. There is a legitimate scientific question about which vaccine technology is used for which disease.What is causing concern among scientists is that pulling mRNA research means we will not have those vaccines at times when we need to do what no other technology can.Prof Pollard says   I don t think there s the evidence they are hugely better for protection, but where RNA tech is streets ahead of everything else is responding to outbreaks. The world is highly drilled at making new flu vaccines each year. But even then, there is a six-month process of deciding on the new flu strains to be targeted, growing the vaccine at scale in chicken eggs and then distributing it. Brand new vaccines take even longer.But with mRNA, you can have the new vaccine in six to eight weeks, and then tens or hundreds of millions of doses a few months later.Some of the projects that have had their funding pulled in the US were preparing for a bird flu pandemic. That virus, H5N1, has been devastating bird populations and jumping into a wide range of other animals including American cattle. That doesn t make sense and if we do get a human pandemic of bird flu it could be seen as a catastrophic error,  says Prof Finn.But the ramifications of the US turning away from mRNA research could be felt more widely.What impact does this move have on confidence in the current vaccines, mRNA or otherwise? How does it affect the world when the US is one of the most influential countries in medical research? And will it have a knock-on impact on other types of mRNA technology, such as cancer vaccines - or using the approach to treat rare genetic diseases?Prof Pollard poses another question after RFK Jr s move   Does it put us all at risk if a huge market is turning its back on RNA? It is one of the most important technologies we ll see this century in infectious disease, biotherapeutic agents for rare disease and critically for cancer. It s a message I m troubled about.",health,Could RFK Jr's move to pull mRNA vaccine funding be a huge miscalculation?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly75p9yd67o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:18:05 GMT",1241
"Why we need to talk about periods, breasts and injuries in women s sport. Understanding the pressure elite sport puts on women s bodies is pushing athletes to new levels of excellence. The Euros are reaching their conclusion in a massive summer across women s sport.But away from the drama and excitement on the pitch, there is also a scientific revolution taking place. Teams of scientists are researching the unique ways that elite sport affects the female body   how breasts alter the way you run, but the right sports bra could give you the edge  how the menstrual cycle could impact performance and what role period trackers could play  and why is there a higher risk of some injuries, and what can be done to avoid them?It s a far cry from the era when professional female athletes told me they were thought of simply as  mini-men . Cast your mind back to the iconic scene from the final of the last European Championships in 2022.It was extra time at Wembley and Lioness Chloe Kelly scored the winning goal against Germany. In the ensuing euphoria, she whipped off her England shirt showing the world her sports bra.It was fitted by Prof Joanna Wakefield-Scurr, from the University of Portsmouth, who proudly goes by the nickname the Bra Professor. Here are her breast facts Breasts can bounce an average of 11,000 times in a football matchAn average bounce is 8cm  3in  without appropriate supportThey move with up to 5G of force  five times the force of gravity , comparable to the experience of a Formula 1 driverLaboratory experiments   using motion sensors on the chest   have revealed how a shifting mass of breast tissue alters the movement of the rest of the body, and in turn, sporting performance. For some women, their breasts can be really quite heavy and if that weight moves, it can change the movement of your torso, it can even change the amount of force that you exert on the ground,  Prof Wakefield-Scurr tells me. Compensating for bouncing breasts by restricting the movement of your upper body alters the positioning of the pelvis and shortens the length of each stride. That s why sports bras are not just for comfort or fashion, but a piece of performance gear. We actually saw that low breast support meant a reduction in stride length of four centimetres,  Prof Wakefield-Scurr explains. If you lost four centimetres every step in a marathon, it adds up to a mile. Sports bras also protect the delicate structures inside the breast,  if we stretch them, that s permanent,  the professor says, so  it s about prevention rather than cure . The menstrual cycle has a clear impact on the body   it can affect emotions, mood and sleep as well as cause fatigue, headache and cramps.But Calli Hauger-Thackery, a distance runner who has represented Team GB at the Olympics, says talking about its sporting impact is  still so taboo and it shouldn t be, because we re struggling with it .Calli says she always notices the difference in her body in the lead up to her period. I m feeling really fatigued, heavy legs, I  feel like I m  almost running through mud sometimes, everything s more strained than it should be,  she says.Calli finds she  lives  by her menstruation tracker, as being on her period is a source of anxiety  especially when I ve got big races coming up .One of those big races was in April   the Boston Marathon   and Calli s period was due. She finished in sixth place, and recalls that she  luckily got through  - but says she can t help wondering if she could have done even better.",health,"Why we need to talk about periods, breasts and injuries in women's sport",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq53v066x52o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:55:30 GMT",616
"Students feel  let down  by mental health support - but should it really be up to universities?. The number of students reporting mental health concerns is rising. But to what extent should the onus be on universities? Listen to Joe read this articleWhen Imogen arrived at the University of Nottingham in September 2022, she carried with her a letter addressed to the student wellbeing services. As a teenager, she struggled with anxiety and self-harm. The letter, written by her former head of year, was a direct plea to the university to help her.Three years on, Imogen  not her real name  feels let down. She has since been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  and autism, and was referred for university counselling multiple times, but, instead of helping, she says it made her feel worse. I felt like I was being thrown between services, no-one wanted me and no-one could help me. Another student at Nottingham, Leacsaidh, who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder  OCD  at age 17, characterises the services as  one-size-fits-all . She says that when she sought help for self-harm, she was simply given website references. The University of Nottingham is certainly not an outlier, nor is it considered worse than other British universities for mental health support.Jana, an international student at King s College London  KCL , was diagnosed with anxiety by a university GP, which made her eligible for certain adjustments, but she found the process of implementing them  painful . Requests for deadline extensions, she says, were delayed by clerical errors, compounding her anxiety at an already stressful time.A King s College London spokesperson said   The wellbeing of our students is our top priority and we are continually making improvements to our services, which includes streamlining processes for approving adjustments for students with disabilities and wherever possible, removing barriers. Given that the number of young people reporting mental health concerns is rising, these sorts of issues could get worse. For its part, the University of Nottingham says it has invested in its specialist wellbeing services in recent years. A spokesperson says they  encourage any student with concerns to discuss their experiences with us .However, they also stress   University services are there to support the mental health and wellbeing of our students but are not a replacement for clinical NHS services to treat more serious or complex needs. Which raises the question  are institutions really letting students down - or is the expectation placed on them part of the issue? And to what extent should the responsibility fall on universities in the first place? The extent of the crisis in student mental health came to public attention in 2018 after Natasha Abrahart, a physics student at the University of Bristol, killed herself. Ten others are believed to have taken their own lives at the university between 2016 and 2018.In the decade to 2023-24, the number of students with a mental health condition almost quadrupled, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency  HESA , increasing every year to 2022-23 before dipping slightly in 2023-24.That year, some 122,430 students in the UK  out of a total of 2.9 million  said they had a mental health condition. Most were undergraduates, and the majority were women. Part of this may be down to age. Late adolescence  18 to 21  is what Dr Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, calls the  peak ages  for many mental health problems, including OCD, anxiety and depression.There is no recent parallel data that directly compares the mental health of young people who do not attend university or higher education. But combining the stresses of late adolescence, academic pressure, learning how to live independently, and, for some, part-time work, creates the  prime conditions  for mental health issues, argues Dr Mann.A lack of  resilience  also concerns her.  I m not talking about serious mental health issues, such as severe OCD, anxiety and depression,  she says.  Of course they need help. But young people seem to struggle more coping with the day-to-day stresses of everyday life.",health,Students feel 'let down' by mental health support - but should it really be up to universities?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93kzkle81wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 04:24:02 GMT",675
"Babies made using three people s DNA are born free of hereditary disease. The method was pioneered by UK scientists to overcome devastating, often fatal inherited diseases. Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say.The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman.The technique has been legal here for a decade but we now have the first proof it is leading to children born free of incurable mitochondrial disease.These conditions are normally passed from mother to child, starving the body of energy. This can cause severe disability and some babies die within days of being born. Couples know they are at risk if previous children, family members or the mother has been affected.Children born through the three-person technique inherit most of their DNA, their genetic blueprint, from their parents, but also get a tiny amount, about 0.1 , from the second woman. This is a change that is passed down the generations.None of the families who have been through the process are speaking publicly to protect their privacy, but have issued anonymous statements through the Newcastle Fertility Centre where the procedures took place.  After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope - and then it gave us our baby,  said the mother of a baby girl. We look at them now, full of life and possibility, and we re overwhelmed with gratitude.  The mother of a baby boy added   Thanks to this incredible advancement and the support we received, our little family is complete. The emotional burden of mitochondrial disease has been lifted, and in its place is hope, joy, and deep gratitude.  Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every one of our cells. They are the reason we breathe as they use oxygen to convert food into the form of energy our bodies use as fuel.Defective mitochondria can leave the body with insufficient energy to keep the heart beating as well as causing brain damage, seizures, blindness, muscle weakness and organ failure.About one in 5,000 babies are born with mitochondrial disease. The team in Newcastle anticipate there is demand for 20 to 30 babies born through the three-person method each year. Some parents have faced the agony of having multiple children die from these diseases.Mitochondria are passed down only from mother to child. So this pioneering fertility technique uses both parents and a woman who donates her healthy mitochondria.The science was developed more than a decade ago at Newcastle University and the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a specialist service opened within the NHS in 2017.",health,Babies made using three people's DNA are born free of hereditary disease,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8179z199vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 21:00:21 GMT",451

"Why are measles cases rising in the UK?. What are the symptoms of measles and how dangerous is the disease? A young child has died at Liverpool s Alder Hey Hospital after contracting measles, raising concerns about the spread of the disease.Cases have been rising in the UK and around the world, with more than 500 reported since January in England alone.The increase is being blamed on the poor uptake of the MMR  measles, mumps and rubella  vaccine. Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes.Common symptoms include high feversore, red and watery eyescoughingsneezingSmall white spots may appear inside the mouth.A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading.The rash can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.Babies and young children, pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk.Measles can be fatal, but this is rare.Between 2000-2023, 26 children and adults died in England and Wales from measles or related infections.Before the latest case in Liverpool, the last child to die as a result of measles complications was 10-year-old Renae Archer, in 2023. You can catch measles at any age. It is possible - but highly unlikely - to catch it twice as the body builds up immunity to the disease after being infected.Getting it while pregnant can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage or babies being born small.The NHS advises adults to ensure they have had both doses of the MMR vaccine before starting a family. There were 2,911 confirmed cases of measles in England in 2024, which is the highest annual total since 2012.According to the UK Health Security Agency  UKHSA , this started with an outbreak in Birmingham, which was then overtaken by a surge of cases in London. More than 60  of the 2024 cases were in children aged 10 and under.

"Alzheimer s has isolated us, says Fiona Phillips  husband. Martin Frizell has spoken of the social isolation faced by the couple since the former GMTV presenter was diagnosed. The husband of TV presenter Fiona Phillips says they have become socially isolated since her Alzheimer s diagnosis.Phillips, who hosted ITV s GMTV breakfast programme, announced in 2023 that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer s the previous year, at the age of 61.In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Martin Frizell, a former editor of ITV s This Morning show, said   You become almost invisible. He added   We still have some close friends. But I think people think, oh gosh, Fiona, maybe she doesn t look the same, or they don t know what to say, or it brings into sharp focus their own mortality.  At the time of her diagnosis, Phillips said she had suffered months of brain fog and anxiety - and initially had attributed the symptoms to the menopause. It s something I might have thought I d get at 80,  Phillips explained.  But I was still only 61 years old. Mr Frizell said he now does not know what to do either with her cookery books or designer clothes - both things she no longer uses. Fiona hasn t cooked in two years,  he said.

Mother-of-two Phillips has written a memoir since her diagnosis, which is due to be released on Thursday.Mr Frizell contributed to the book, saying he had intended to write  a few paragraphs  but ended up writing  24,000 words . I started off writing about what a great woman she is and just how horrible it is and dreadfully unlucky that she is the latest in the long line of her family to get it,  he told the Telegraph. Then I just got very angry as to what little support there is. As a family, we just kind of get through it and at some point we will need more support, but there s just nothing really. In 2023, Phillips said the disease had  decimated  her family - with her mother, father and uncle all receiving a diagnosis.She had cared for her parents and made two documentaries about the disease - one in 2009 called Mum, Dad, Alzheimer s and Me, about her family s history of dementia, and My Family and Alzheimer s in 2010.The NHS says the term dementia encompasses  a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning .Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK - but its exact cause is not yet fully understood. There is currently no cure for the disease, though some treatments can temporarily improve symptoms.One in three people born in the UK will be diagnosed with dementia, according to the Alzheimer s Society charity.Speaking to ITV s This Morning on Friday, Mr Frizell said   Society has decided we re not going to take it as seriously as we should. The money that s there for Alzheimer s research, it s like buying a Starbucks cup of coffee, basically trying to fight a disease. It s impossible. Phillips presented GMTV between 1993 and 2008. She has since led a number of documentaries and episodes of Panorama, and was a columnist for the Mirror.",health,"Alzheimer's has isolated us, says Fiona Phillips' husband",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77vm4k635mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 13:22:48 GMT",589
"Vaccine roll-outs cut deaths by 60  - study. The study looked at vaccines deployed during outbreaks of five deadly diseases. Emergency vaccination programmes   rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases   are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60  over a period of 23 years, according to a new study. A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented.Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever.The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars. Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases   Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60 .The number of overall cases of these infections were also reduced by nearly 60 .The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks.There were economic benefits too   worth an estimated  32 billion. These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn t take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. It s believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than  53 billion. The study was backed by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which was responsible for many of the programmes. Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation s CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be. For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases. This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks.  It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come. Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.",health,Vaccine roll-outs cut deaths by 60% - study,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9x4yd27mro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:50:54 GMT",403
"South Africans fear spike in HIV infections as US aid cuts bite. South Africa has been at the forefront of the successful battle to halt the spread of HIV Aids - until now. Gugu used to collect her antiretrovirals from a USAID-funded clinic in central Johannesburg.But when President Trump s cuts to aid funding were announced earlier this year, she and thousands of other HIV-positive patients across South Africa suddenly faced an uncertain future.Gugu was lucky, the clinic where she got the medication that helps suppress her symptoms contacted her before it closed down. I was one of the people who was able to get their medication in bulk. I usually collect a three-month prescription. But before my clinic closed, they gave me nine months  worth of medication. She will run out of antiretrovirals  ARVs  in September, and then plans on going to her local public hospital for more.A former sex worker, the 54-year-old found out she was HIV-positive after she d quit the industry.Ten years ago she got a chesty cough, and initially thought it was tuberculosis. She went to a doctor who told her she had a chest infection and treated her for it.But when the treatment failed, she went to a clinic to get an HIV test. By then I already assumed that I was HIV-positive, and I told the nurse this. She was right, and she has been on ARVs ever since. We re not using her real name at her request.She currently works as a project coordinator for an NGO. We help pregnant sex workers get their ARVs, to ensure their children are born HIV-negative. We also do home visits to make sure that the mothers take their medication on time, and to look after their babies when they go for their monthly check-ups. Many HIV-positive sex workers in South Africa relied on private clinics funded by the US government s now-defunct aid agency, USAID, to get their prescriptions and treatments.But most of the facilities closed after US President Donald Trump cut most foreign aid earlier this year. Gugu believes that many sex workers could be discouraged from going to public hospitals for their ARVs if they can no longer get them from clinics. The problem with going to public hospitals is the time factor. In order to get serviced at these facilities, you have to arrive at 4 or 5am, and they may spend the whole day waiting for their medication. For sex workers, time is money,  Gugu says.She adds that she recently went to her local hospital with some friends to register her details and build a relationship with staff. The nurse who attended to us was very rude. She told us there was nothing special about sex workers. She thinks this could lead to many sex workers defaulting on their medication,  especially because their hospital files contain a lot of personal information, and the concern is that sometimes the nurses at these local clinics aren t always the most sensitive in dealing with this kind of information . In a report released on Thursday, the UN body in charge of fighting HIV Aids does not single out the US, but says that drastic cuts from a number of donors have sent shockwaves around the world, that the  phenomenal progress  in tackling the illness risks being reversed. New HIV infections have been reduced by 40  since 2010, and 4.4 million children have been protected from acquiring HIV since 2000. More than 26 million lives have been saved,  UNAids says, warning that if the world does not act, there could be an extra six million new HIV infections and four million Aids-related deaths by 2029.UNAids said that, before the funding cuts, the annual numbers of new HIV infections and Aids-related deaths had sunk to their lowest levels in more than 30 years.All of the data published in the report is from before the US and other donors slashed funding earlier this year. But it does highlight how much progress could be lost as a result of these cuts.Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a 56  decline in the number of new infections. The region is still the epicentre of the epidemic - half of all new infections last year were from the continent. But four African countries - Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda and Zimbabwe - were on track to achieve a 90  decline in new infections by 2030 compared with 2010.Another success story for Africa has been the performance of antiretrovirals, which help suppress HIV symptoms. Along with other medical advances in the field, they helped increase life in sub-Saharan Africa from 56 years in 2010 to 62 years in 2024.The turnaround began when then-US President George W Bush launched an ambitious programme to combat HIV Aids in 2003, saying it would serve the  strategic and moral interests  of the US.Known as the President s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief  Pepfar , it led to the investment of more than  100bn   74bn  in the global HIV Aids response - the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in the world.South Africa has about 7.7 million people living with HIV, the highest number in the world, according to UNAids.About 5.9 million of them receive antiretroviral treatment, resulting in a 66  decrease in Aids-related deaths since 2010, the UN agency adds.South Africa s government says Pepfar funding contributed about 17  to its HIV Aids programme. The money was used for various projects, including running mobile clinics to make it easier for patients to get treatment.The Trump administration s cuts have raised concern that infection rates could spike again.  I think we re going to start seeing an increase in the number of HIV infections, the number of TB cases, the number of other infectious diseases,  Prof Lynn Morris, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Johannesburg s Wits University, tells the BBC. And we re going to start seeing a reversal of what was essentially a real success story. We were getting on top of some of these things. Gugu points out that treatment is a matter of life and death, especially for vulnerable populations like sex workers. People don t want to default on their ARVs. They re scared that they re going to die if they don t get access to them.The cuts have also affected research aimed at finding an HIV vaccine and a cure for Aids. There s the long-term impact, which is that we re not going to be getting new vaccines for HIV,  Prof Morris adds.  We re not going to be keeping on top of viruses that are circulating. Even with new viruses that might appear, we re not going to have the surveillance infrastructure that we once had. South Africa has been one of the global leaders in HIV research. Many of the medications that help prevent the virus, and which have benefitted people around the world, were trialled in South Africa.This includes Prep  pre-exposure prophylaxis , a medication which stops HIV-negative people from catching the virus.Another breakthrough preventive drug released this year, Lenacapavir, an injection taken twice a year and that offers total protection from HIV, was also tried in South Africa. In a lab at Wits University s Health Sciences campus, a small group of scientists are still working on a vaccine for HIV. They are part of the Brilliant Consortium, a group of labs working across eight African countries to develop a vaccine for the virus. We were developing a vaccine test to see how well that works, and then we would trial it on humans,  Abdullah Ely, an Associate Professor at Wits University, tells the BBC in his lab.  The plan was to run the trials in Africa based on research carried out by Africans because we want that research to actually benefit our community as well as all mankind. But the US funding cuts threw their work into doubt.  When the stop order came, it meant we had to stop everything. Only some of us have been able to get additional funding so we could continue our work. It s set us back months, probably could even be a year,  Prof Ely says.The lab lacks funding to carry out clinical trials scheduled for later this year. That is a very big loss to South Africa and the continent. It means that any potential research that comes out of Africa will have to be tested in Europe, or the US,  Prof Ely says. In June, universities asked the government for a bailout of 4.6bn South African rand   260m   190m  over the next three years to cover some of the funding lost from the US.  We are pleading for support because South Africa is leading in HIV research, but it s not leading for itself. This has ramifications on the practice and policies of the entire globe,  says Dr Phethiwe Matutu, head of Universities South Africa. South Africa s Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Wednesday that some alternative funding for research had been secured. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have agreed to donate 100m rand each with immediate effect, while the government would make available 400m rand over the next three years, he said. This would bring the total to 600m rand, way below the 4.6bn rand requested by researchers.As for Gugu, she had hoped that by the time she was elderly, a cure for HIV Aids would have been found, but she is less optimistic now. I look after a nine-year-old. I want to live as long as I can to keep taking care of him,  she tells the BBC.  This isn t just a problem for right now, we have to think about how it s going to affect the next generation of women and young people.",health,South Africans fear spike in HIV infections as US aid cuts bite,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce83r14vlnpo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:06:57 GMT",1626
"Is RFK Jr s divisive plan to Make America Healthy Again fearmongering - or revolutionary?. The most powerful public health official in the US is reviled by some medics - but even some of his critics accept that he is bringing drive to healthcare areas that have long been neglected Listen to Jim read this articleThere s a saying that Robert F Kennedy Jr is very fond of. He used it on the day he was confirmed as US health secretary.  A healthy person has a thousand dreams, a sick person only has one,  he said as he stood in the Oval Office.  60  of our population has only one dream   that they get better. The most powerful public health official in the US has made it his mission to tackle what he describes as an epidemic of chronic illness in America, a catch-all term that covers everything from obesity and diabetes to heart disease.His diagnosis that the US is experiencing an epidemic of ill health is a view shared by many healthcare experts in the country.But Kennedy also has a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies, from the suggestion that Covid-19 targeted and spared certain ethnic groups to the idea that chemicals in tap water could be making children transgender. And after taking office, he slashed thousands of jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services and eliminated whole programmes at the Centers for Disease Control  CDC . On the one hand, it s extraordinarily exciting to have a federal official take on chronic disease,  says Marion Nestle, a retired professor of public health at New York University.  On the other, the dismantling of the federal public health apparatus cannot possibly help with the agenda.  Kennedy is reviled by parts of the medical and scientific communities. He was described to me as an  evil nihilist  by Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University.But even some of Kennedy s critics accept that he is bringing drive and ambition to areas of healthcare that have been neglected. Is it possible that the man who attracts so much criticism - and in some quarters, hate - might actually start making America healthy again? There s one industry that Kennedy had set his sights on long before joining the Trump administration  multinational food companies have, he has said, poisoned American children with artificial additives already banned in other countries. We have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now,  he claimed on Fox News last year.His first target was food colourings, with a promise to phase out the use of petroleum-based dyes by the end of 2026.Chemicals, with names like  Green No. 3  and  Red No. 40 , have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children, and cancer in some animal studies. What s happening in this administration is really interesting,  says Vani Hari, a food blogger and former Democrat who is now an influential voice in the Make America Healthy Again  MAHA  movement.  MAHA is all about how do we get people off processed food, and one way to do that is to regulate the chemicals companies use. There are some signs this pressure may be paying off.The food giant PepsiCo, for example, said in a recent trading update that Lays crisps and Tostitos snacks  will be out of artificial colours by the end of this year . Kennedy struck a voluntary agreement with the food industry but it only came after individual states from California to West Virginia had already started introducing their own laws. In the case of food dyes, companies will have to act because states are banning them  anyway  and they won t want to have to formulate separate products for separate states,  says Prof Nestle, an author and longtime critic of the industry.More recently Kennedy has signalled he backs a radical food bill in Texas that could target additives in some products ranging from sweets, to cereals and fizzy drinks. Packets may soon have to carry a high-contrast label stating,  WARNING  This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom. The Consumer Brands Association, which represents some of the largest food manufacturers, opposes this, saying the ingredients used in the US food supply are safe and have been rigorously studied.It s difficult to imagine that kind of regulation could ever be signed off in a state like Texas without the political backing of Kennedy and President Trump.",health,Is RFK Jr's divisive plan to Make America Healthy Again fearmongering - or revolutionary?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq7jx3dlj9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:04:11 GMT",763
"How is your hospital doing as NHS battles to bring down waiting times?. Use our interactive tracker to see if treatment waits are getting better at your local hospital Doctors and patient groups warn that the NHS in England is facing an uphill struggle on the government s number one NHS priority   improving hospital waiting times.They are concerned about the lack of progress towards hitting the 18-week waiting time target, one of Labour s key election pledges. It has not been met since 2015.Since the election, the proportion of patients waiting less than 18 weeks has improved, but by less than a percentage point.And an analysis of hospital trusts by BBC Verify found over a third are seeing a smaller share of patients within 18 weeks since the NHS improvement plan was announced in January.But the government said it was premature to suggest progress was too slow as the NHS had only started to push forward with the government s improvement plan in April. Before that, it had focussed on other priorities, including tackling the very longest waits. It said the fact waiting times had continued to improve even during winter - the first time this had happened for 10 years - was encouraging.And in an interview with the BBC, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said progress would go  further and faster  in the coming years, helped by the extra money being invested and the 10-year NHS plan, due to be published next week.He said lots had been achieved so far, including millions more appointments being carried out and the total number of patients on the waiting list dropping to below 7.4 million, its lowest level for two years.On the 18-week target, he acknowledged there was  much more to do , before adding   There s a big challenge here. Are we going to meet it? Absolutely. We are not going to let people down. The government has promised to hit the target by March 2029, which requires 92  of patients to be seen within 18 weeks.In January, every hospital trust was given their own individual performance targets to meet by March 2026 as the first step in achieving that pledge.BBC Verify is launching an interactive tool, which we will update when there is new data, so you can find out how well your local NHS services are doing. We have included NHS trusts in England that had at least 5,000 cases waiting in November. John Winnik does not know when he will get treatment for a problem with his back.The grandfather from West Yorkshire, who has arthritis, has been on an NHS waiting list for nine months so far - much longer than the 18 weeks the health service says should be the limit.The 73-year-old paid privately to go to Lithuania for a right hip replacement last year, having spent more than a year on the NHS waiting list.He s also having injections in his left hip, which will eventually need replacing. I m living in constant pain,  said Mr Winnik, a self-employed consultant in the glass lamination industry.  I ve forgotten what it is like to not be in pain, to be honest. I haven t played golf for two years and if I do five minutes of gardening, I m shattered.  Royal College of Surgeons of England president Tim Mitchell said   The NHS is changing course, but the sails still lack wind. Progress is being made in some parts of the country, but it s too slow to meet the government s ambition of hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament. Delayed operations mean patients left waiting in pain, with their condition potentially deteriorating. He said the extra money being put into the NHS in the coming years would help, but  serious underinvestment  in infrastructure like operating theatres over the years is hampering efforts.Deborah Alsina, chief executive of the patient group Versus Arthritis, also has doubts, saying there was scepticism about whether the rapid progress needed could be achieved.And she added   It is impossible to overstate the personal, physical and mental toll of being stuck on a waiting list in daily pain, sometimes for years. There s also a wider impact on society, with many people on waiting lists having to drop out of work, despite wanting to stay in employment, and becoming increasingly reliant on others. The interim targets for March 2026 mean trusts either have to be seeing 60  of patients within 18 weeks of referral or improve on their November 2024 position by five percentage points - whichever is the greater.The NHS overall in England is expected to ensure 65  of patients do not wait longer than 18 weeks - currently less than 60  are.The majority of trusts have already started making progress, however a BBC Verify analysis shows 50 - more than one third - are now further away from the target since November 2024.Once the trusts that have improved are taken into account the overall trend though is positive. A handful of trusts have already got to where they need to be by next March - as long as they can keep their waiting lists down.Mersey and West Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust had more than 48,000 patients waiting less than 18 weeks so far for treatment, 64.2  of the total, in April. That is up from 58.7  in November.East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust also reached 60.1  in April, up from 54.9  in November.The biggest target for improvement was set for The Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust in Harlow, according to our analysis. In November, 41.8  of its patients were waiting less than 18 weeks. By April, that had risen to about 48.8  - one of the biggest improvements in England so far. But it needs to rise further by more than 11 percentage points by next March.PAHT chief executive Thom Lafferty said they were  delighted  with their progress. We recognise the impact for patients who are waiting for care and we are enhancing integration and collaboration with our partners to ensure that patients can access the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Some trusts have a higher mountain to climb because their figures have dipped since November.Mid and South Essex NHS Trust started out with 52.8  of patients waiting less than 18 weeks in November. But when the clock started in April, it had fallen to 47 .Two of its theatres at Basildon Hospital have been closed for work along with some of the trust s procedure rooms and it has had an increase in referrals.Chief executive Matthew Hopkins said it was putting on extra clinics and had a new orthopaedic procedure room opening soon, adding   We are confident we will improve our waiting times and improve patient experience. Others that have fallen despite requiring large improvements include the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital  RJAH  in Shropshire  down from 48.3  to 44.9   and Countess of Chester, down from 49.6  to 47.1 .Cathy Chadwick, chief operating officer for Countess of Chester, said more clinics and investment in new technology would bring down waiting lists and the trust was confident of meeting the target by next March.A spokesman for RJAH said   We have a clear ambition to hit the target of 60  by March 2026, and are confident that the plans we have put in place will enable us to do so.",health,How is your hospital doing as NHS battles to bring down waiting times?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedg8dz7996o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 26 Jun 2025 23:08:44 GMT",1224
"Emma is doing something she swore she never would - buying her kids vapes. One month on from the disposable vape ban, one mum says it has had little impact on her children s nicotine consumption. Emma is doing something she swore she would never do.In an attempt to have some control over her children s vaping habits, she s resorted to buying them the vapes herself.She s not proud of it, but says it feels like the only way to keep her two teenagers safe and reduce the high levels of nicotine they were consuming. It went against every bone in my body to do that, but they re addicted,  Emma says.  It s not a simple case of telling them to stop   it is so much harder than that. Emma believes her son, who she has asked the BBC not to name, began vaping in primary school.He managed to keep it from her for a while, but by the time he got to high school, his protests of  that vape s not mine  had started to wear thin.By the time Emma s son was 15, he was becoming breathless, contracted tonsillitis, and, at one point, was in so much pain, Emma called an ambulance. The paramedics said the incessant vaping could be causing this,  she says.  They told him to try and stop, or at the very least cut down. It was then Emma decided something had to change   she was going to take control and buy the vapes - trying to reduce their nicotine intake from 20mg to 10mg. I warned them   if I see them with a device that has more nicotine in   then I ll stop buying them any, full stop. Emma says she felt she could then be confident the vapes would be from a reputable supplier, they wouldn t be illegal and contain other harmful products, and she could control the level of nicotine. Not only is it illegal to sell vapes to anyone under the age of 18, it is also illegal to buy them for anyone underage. Emma knows what she is doing isn t legal, but feels this was her only choice.She believes she has managed to reduce her son s nicotine intake, in part by buying the vapes, but also by having such an open conversation with him.But Emma says the disposable vape ban, which came into effect on 1 June, has had little impact on her children s nicotine consumption.It was introduced due to environmental concerns and to reduce the rising number of children and young people vaping.While vapes provide a far healthier alternative to cigarettes, there are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction - with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavours and cheap prices.Health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to the lungs, heart and brain.But weeks after the ban came into force, Kate Pike from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, says she fears it won t make any difference - and she says some rechargeable vapes, which are still legal to buy, are being marketed directly at children. We are finding compliant products   vapes that are refillable and rechargeable   with packs of stickers in them,  she says.  What adult is going to want to decorate their vape with stickers? She also says it is very difficult to tell the difference between the now-illegal disposables and the legal refillable vapes. And due to some being fitted with pre-filled pods, they are still being used  like disposable vapes and discarded.  At Alder Hey Children s Hospital in Liverpool, home to the UK s first NHS vaping clinic for children, Professor Rachel Isba says parents should not be hard on themselves   they are fighting a battle against the might of a huge vaping industry. The important thing is not to judge your child  the world our young people live in is a difficult place to grow up in,  she says.  There are so many competing pressures. Her clinic supports 11-15-year-olds who have been referred by other NHS healthcare professionals. It has been open since January and already has a six-week waiting list. The children that come to see me have to want to see me and understand why they are here,  Prof Isba says.  It could be that they are noticing a change with their bodies   they struggle to play sport without being out of breath for instance, or they re coughing up blood, or they just know they re addicted and they want to stop or cut down.  She says some young people are sleeping with vapes under their pillows so they can get a nicotine hit in the middle of the night, and their addiction can be so strong they experience  micro withdrawals  in school. They are consuming nicotine so frequently that they begin to feel anxious if they don t have it   even for the length of a double maths lesson, for example. They then think they need the vape to reduce the anxiety, she explains, but it is nicotine withdrawal that is causing those feelings in the first place.Prof Isba offers nicotine replacement therapy   such as gums and patches   and talks to them about how vaping affects their lives. We might discuss ways they might be able to cut down, what triggers them to vape and even how much money they might save simply by not vaping. She says the government s Tobacco and Vapes bill is a good step forward but would like to see more paediatric addiction services across the NHS.The problem is  far greater  than her clinic, she says, and she is concerned vaping could become a gateway drug into smoking and other dependences.Dan from Twickenham, a father of three boys, agrees. He says the conversation about youth vaping is redundant because, he says, that  horse has bolted .His 17-year-old got expelled from school in February because he was caught with cannabis in his vape, and his 14-year-old was close to losing his school place recently because of a similar issue. Vaping is a gateway drug,  Dan says.  They become addicted to nicotine and then harder stuff follows.  They ve definitely smoked  cigarettes  and now my eldest is addicted to nicotine pouches. It s never ending. A government spokesperson told the BBC it was taking  tough action  to tackle youth vaping - including giving Trading Standards the power to issue  200 on-the-spot fines to anyone found selling tobacco or vapes to people underage.They also added that single-use vapes were a  blight on our streets  and that the government had made it compulsory for all vape retailers to provide recycling bins.",health,Emma is doing something she swore she never would - buying her kids vapes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdv3jq1pnyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 23:21:07 GMT",1117
